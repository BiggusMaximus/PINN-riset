A modified whale-dragonfly algorithm and self-adaptive cuckoo search-based clustering strategy for augmenting network lifetime in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5482,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"cluster router (CR),clustering,energy stability,modified whale-dragonfly optimization algorithm (MWDOA),self-adaptive cuckoo search (SACS)","Designing an energy efficient and durable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a key challenge as it personifies potential and reactive functionalities in harsh antagonistic environment at which wired system deployment is completely infeasible. Majority of the clustering mechanisms contributed to the literature concentrated on augmenting network lifetime and energy stability. However, energy consumption incurred by cluster heads (CHs) are high and thereby results in minimized network lifetime and frequent CHs selection. In this paper, a modified whale-dragonfly optimization algorithm and self-adaptive cuckoo search-based clustering strategy (MWIDOA-SACS) is proposed for sustaining energy stability and augment network lifetime. In specific, MWIDOA-SACS is included for exploiting the fitness values that aids in determining two optimal nodes that are selected as optimal CH and cluster router (CR) nodes in the network. In MWIDOA, the search conduct of dragon flies is completely updated through whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for preventing load balancing at CHs. It minimized the overhead of CH by adopting CHs and CR for collecting information from cluster members and transmitting the aggregated data from CHs to the base station (BS). It included self-adaptive cuckoo search (SACS) for achieving sink mobility using radius, energy stability, received signal strength, and throughput for achieving optimal data transmission process after partitioning the network into unequal clusters. Simulation experiments of the proposed MWIDOA-SACS confirmed better performance in terms of total residual energy by 21.28% and network lifetime by 26.32%, compared to the competitive CH selection strategies.",24 March 2023,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Sebasthiyar Jaya Pratha,Valayapathy Asanambigai,Seenapuram Rajan Mugunthan,","(Research Scholar, Department of CSE, Faculty of Engineering and Technology Annamalai University Chidambaram India),(Research Scholar, Department of CSE, Faculty of Engineering and Technology Annamalai University Chidambaram India),(Department of CSE Dr. N.G.P.

Impact of rate of recurrent communication of sensor node on network lifetime in a wireless sensor network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-smt.2016.0290,13,Research Article,Wiley,"wireless sensor networks,recurrent communication rate,sensor node,network lifetime,wireless sensor network,cluster head reselection frequency,energy drainage parameters,residual energy,low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy,energy consumption,time overhead","Recent research works suggest cluster head reselection as a mechanism for network lifetime improvement. Cluster head reselection is either energy or time dependent. However, frequent cluster head reselection increases time overhead and energy consumption leading to reduction in network lifetime. Hence, an attempt is made to minimise the cluster head reselection frequency. The cluster head reselection is carried out whenever the energy of current cluster head falls below the threshold and this threshold corresponds to the minimum energy required for a node to survive. It is this selection of the threshold value that favours reduction in cluster head reselection frequency. Further, the cluster head reselection is based on energy drainage parameters such as the rate of recurrent communication of sensor node in addition to the residual energy of the node and distance of the node from the base station. To demonstrate the effect of rate of recurrent communication of sensor node on cluster head reselection, experiments are conducted both through simulation and hardware. Further, to study the effectiveness of the proposal, comparisons are made with other algorithms such as low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH)-C, adaptive decentralised re-clustering protocol and T-LEACH.

Toward Large-Scale Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Rail-Based Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033514,5,Research Article,Wiley,"continuous soil moisture monitoring,soil moisture products,hydrological observations,automatic geophysical roving,root zone soil water,time-series soil water content mapping","Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an ∼9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (≤10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.",15 February 2023,Water Resources Research,"Daniel Altdorff,Sascha E.

ECaD: Energy-efficient routing in flying ad hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4156,69,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"connectivity,energy efficiency,flooding process,routing,simulation,UAV","Much progress can be expected in the domain of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication by the next decade. The cooperation between multiple UAVs in the air exchanging data among themselves can naturally form a flying ad hoc network (FANET). Such networks can be the key support to accomplish several kinds of missions while providing the required assistance to terrestrial networks. However, they are confronted with many challenges and difficulties, which are due to the high mobility of UAVs, the frequent packet losses, and the weak links between UAVs, all affecting the reliability of the data delivery. Furthermore, the unbalanced energy consumption may result in earlier UAV failure and consequently accelerate the decrease of the network lifetime, thus disrupting the overall network. This paper supports the use of the movement information and the residual energy level of each UAV to guarantee a high level of communication stability while predicting a sudden link breakage prior to its occurrence. A robust route discovery process is used to explore routing paths where the balanced energy consumption, the link breakage prediction, and the connectivity degree of the discovered paths are all considered. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through a series of simulations.

In WSNs, longer packets may experience higher loss rates due to harsh channel conditions. On the other hand, shorter packets may suffer from greater overhead. Hence, the optimal packet size must be chosen to enhance various performance metrics of WSNs. To this end, many approaches have been proposed to determine the optimum packet size in WSNs. In the literature, packet size optimization studies focus on a specific application or deployment environment. However, there is no comprehensive and recent survey paper that categorizes these different approaches. To address this need, in this paper, recent studies and techniques on data packet size optimization for terrestrial WSNs, underwater WSNs, wireless underground sensor networks, and body area sensor networks are reviewed to motivate the research community to further investigate this promising research area.

A Hyper-Heuristic Heterogeneous Multisensor Node Scheme for Energy Efficiency in Larger Wireless Sensor Networks Using DEEC-Gaussian Algorithm,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/6658840,5,Research Article,Wiley,,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) is an intellect-sustainable network that comprises multiple spatially distributed sensor nodes and several sink nodes that collect data from sensors. WSNs remain an active research area in the literature due to challenging factors such as the selection of sensor location according to a given premise, finding optimal routing algorithm, and ensuring energy efficiency and consumption. Minimizing energy and prolonging the network lifetime in the WSNs are the focus of this research work. In the literature, a clustering approach is used in grouping sensor nodes into clusters and is seen as an effective technique used in optimizing energy consumption in WSNs. Hence, in this paper, we put forward a novel clustering-based approach by amalgamating the Gaussian elimination method with the Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering to produce DEEC_Gaussian (DEEC_Gaus) to stabilize energy efficiency optimization in WSNs. We took the advantages of DEEC and Gaussian elimination algorithms to resolve energy efficiency problems in WSNs. DEEC presents attributes such as increased heterogeneity performance level, clustering stability in operation, and energy efficiency which helps to prolong network lifetime while the Gaussian elimination algorithm added an additional advantage to improve and optimize energy efficiency, to aggregate packets of operations performed in the network lifestyle of energy efficiency in WSNs. The simulations were carried out using MATLAB software with 1000 to 1500 nodes. The performance of the proposed work was compared with state-of-the-art algorithms such as DEEC, DDEEC, and EDEEC_E. The simulated results presented show that the proposed DEEC-Gauss outperformed the three other conventional algorithms in terms of network lifetime, first node dead, tenth node dead, alive nodes, and the overall timing of the packets received at the base station. The results showed that the proposed hyper-heuristic heterogeneous multisensor DEEC-Gauss algorithm presented an average percentage of 3.0% improvement for the tenth node dead (TND) and further improvement of 4.8% for the first node dead (FND).

If distance of an event node (source node) to the sink is within the sensing range, then the event data is transmitted to the sink. Otherwise, event node broadcasts bandwidth requirement to nodes. The surrounding nodes reply with bandwidth availability which is computed using fuzzy inference system situated in the node. The reply also comprises of node's residual energy and its distance to the sink. Event node identifies neighbour nodes which can provide the required bandwidth. The event node then selects the forwarder node from the list of neighbour nodes based on their residual energy and distance to the sink using another fuzzy inference system.

The main priority is denoted by the residual energy and angle between propagation direction and depth direction, and the alternative priority is indicated by the link quality. SPRVA selects the node along the depth direction with more residual energy and better link quality as the best next-hop.

These characteristics necessitate minimum transfer and storage of information in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we exploit the spatio-temporal nature of sensor data to approximate the current values of the sensors based on readings obtained from neighbouring sensors and itself. We propose a tree based polynomial regression algorithm (TREG), that addresses the problem of data compression in wireless sensor networks. Instead of aggregated data, only the coefficients computed by the regression function, TREG are passed to achieve the following goals: (i) the sink can get attribute values in the regions devoid of sensor nodes, and (ii) readings over any portion of the region can be obtained at one time by querying the root of the tree. As the size of the data packet from each tree node to its parent remains constant, the proposed scheme scales very well with growing network density or increased coverage area. Since physical attributes exhibit a gradual change over time, we propose an iterative scheme, UPDATE_COEFF, which obviates the need to perform the regression function repeatedly and uses approximations based on previous readings. Extensive simulations are performed on real world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aggregation algorithm, TREG. Results reveal that for a network density of 0.0025, a complete binary tree of depth 4 could provide the absolute error to be less than 6%. A data compression ratio of about 0.02 is achieved using our proposed algorithm, which is almost independent of the tree depth.

However, these approaches were designed for either specific application environments or complex environments, making the implementation process hard. In this article, we have developed an Internet of Things-enabled optimal data aggregation approach, specifically designed for the intelligent surveillance systems in smart cities, to convert raw data values into the refined ones with minimum possible data loss ratio. Moreover, the proposed scheme bounds every server to perform or carry out the data refinement process to maintain the expected ratio of accuracy and precision. In this approach, ordinary devices are forced to capture and forward data in raw form, preferably without any or minimum possible processing. This reduces the load on ordinary devices in intelligent surveillance systems. Additionally, we have developed a novel approach to eliminate or reduce (if elimination is not possible) noisy data or outliers. It is implemented along with existing state-of-the-art techniques to verify the exceptional performance of the proposed data aggregation approach. These algorithms were compared using various performance evaluation metrics such as refinement ratio, data loss ratio, energy efficiency, and lifetime. The simulation results have verified that the proposed scheme’s performance is better than the existing approaches.",10 August 2022,Mobile Information Systems,"Mohammad Khalid Imam Rahmani,Fazlullah Khan,Abdul Wahab Muzaffar,Mian Ahmad Jan,","(College of Computing and Informatics, Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia seu.edu.sa),(Department of Computer Science, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan, Pakistan awkum.edu.pk),(College of Computing and Informatics, Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia seu.edu.sa),(Department of Computer Science, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Mardan, Pakistan awkum.edu.pk),","Pakistan,Pakistan,Saudi Arabia,Saudi Arabia"
A lightweight intrusion detection framework for wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcm.785,38,Research Article,Wiley,"intrusion detection,wireless sensor networks (WSNs),routing attacks,lightweight,security","In recent years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have demonstrated successful applications for both civil and military tasks. However, sensor networks are susceptible to multiple types of attacks because they are randomly deployed in open and unprotected environments. It is necessary to utilize effective mechanisms to protect sensor networks against multiple types of attacks on routing protocols. In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection framework integrated for clustered sensor networks. Furthermore, we provide algorithms to minimize the triggered intrusion modules in clustered WSNs by using an over-hearing mechanism to reduce the sending alert packets. Our scheme can prevent most routing attacks on sensor networks. In in-depth simulation, the proposed scheme shows less energy consumption in intrusion detection than other schemes.

Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain’s transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item’s authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m2 cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently used clustering-based methods and different routing protocols in clusters which are full of sensor nodes. In this way, cluster heads (CHs), which are regarded as the selected nodes among other nodes within a given cluster, accumulate the information transmitted from their own cluster and send it to the sink. In this method, they try to control power consumption in a balanced way. In clustering method and routing among network nodes, network lifetime is enhanced which leads to achieving the best efficiency and productivity. In this paper, the optimized black hole algorithm is employed to select an optimal CH from sensor nodes. The CH selection is optimized by the free buffer of nodes, residual energy, and distance. The path between source CH and sink is identified by using ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The combination of black hole algorithm and ant colony algorithm, with respect to clustering and routing, leads to the optimization of the proposed method in terms of operational criteria such as power consumption and eventually lifetime enhancement. The results obtained from simulating the proposed method in Matlab environment indicated that it has better results in comparison with other methods.

Traffic and Energy Aware Optimization for Congestion Control in Next Generation Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5575802,24,Research Article,Wiley,,"Congestion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an unavoidable issue in today’s scenario, where data traffic increased to its aggregated capacity of the channel. The consequence of this turns in to overflowing of the buffer at each receiving sensor nodes which ultimately drops the packets, reduces the packet delivery ratio, and degrades throughput of the network, since retransmission of every unacknowledged packet is not an optimized solution in terms of energy for resource-restricted sensor nodes. Routing is one of the most preferred approaches for minimizing the energy consumption of nodes and enhancing the throughput in WSNs, since the routing problem has been proved to be an NP-hard and it has been realized that a heuristic-based approach provides better performance than their traditional counterparts. To tackle all the mentioned issues, this paper proposes an efficient congestion avoidance approach using Huffman coding algorithm and ant colony optimization (ECA-HA) to improve the network performance. This approach is a combination of traffic-oriented and resource-oriented optimization. Specially, ant colony optimization has been employed to find multiple congestion-free alternate paths. The forward ant constructs multiple congestion-free paths from source to sink node, and backward ant ensures about the successful creation of paths moving from sink to source node, considering energy of the link, packet loss rate, and congestion level. Huffman coding considers the packet loss rate on different alternate paths discovered by ant colony optimization for selection of an optimal path.

Simulation experiments show that compared with similar fusion algorithms, the CNNMDA can greatly reduce network energy consumption under the same data amount, and effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of data fusion. In order to solve the problem that parameter synchronization takes too long in synchronous parallel, a dynamic training data allocation algorithm in multimachine synchronous parallel is proposed.

However, the younger site (HC) was typical of natural, developing forests, whereas the older site (WS) was less well developed with low structural complexity. More stressful physicochemical conditions resulting from incomplete tidal flushing (elevated salinity) and variable topography (waterlogging) apparently affected plant survival and growth at the WS restoration site. Lower leaf fall and root production rates at the WS restoration site, compared with that at HC were partly attributable to differences in hydroedaphic conditions and structural development. However, leaf and root inputs at each restoration site were not significantly different from that in reference forests within the same physiographic setting. Macrofaunal consumption of tethered leaves also did not differ with site history, but was dramatically higher at HC compared with WS, reflecting local variation in leaf litter processing rates, primarily by snails (Melampus coffeus). Degradation of leaves and roots in mesh bags was slow overall at restoration sites, however, particularly at WS where aerobic decomposition may have been more limited. These findings indicate that local or regional factors such as salinity regime act together with site history to control primary production and turnover rates of organic matter in restoration sites. Species differences in senescent leaf nitrogen content and degradation rates further suggest that restoration sites dominated by Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle should exhibit slower recycling of nutrients compared with natural basin forests where Avicennia germinans is more abundant. Structural development and biogeochemical functioning of restored mangrove forests thus depend on a number of factors, but site-specific as well as regional or local differences in hydrology and concomitant factors such as salinity and soil waterlogging will have a strong influence over the outcome of restoration projects.",25 December 2001,Restoration Ecology,"Karen L.

There is public concern that fertilization of turfgrass systems, particularly additions of N on golf courses, might be adversely affecting groundwater quality due to nitrate leaching. This study was conducted to measure soil nitrate levels in situ under continuously managed bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) and to evaluate influences from fertilization and mineralization. Two experimental sites were established on 50- and 75-yr-old golf course fairways in the Neuse and Cape Fear River basins in eastern North Carolina. Soil sampling was done seasonally. Results indicate that nitrate-N levels were consistently low (1 to 4 mg kg−1 soil) and similar to adjacent natural areas throughout the 120-cm sampling depths during the 2-yr experiment at both sites. Levels were relatively uniform with depth and across several landscape positions. The soil nitrate levels under fertilized fairways were similar to those in adjacent nonfertilized natural areas, indicating minimal influence from turf management practices. From laboratory mineralization studies and soil temperature data, it was estimated that 60 to 154 kg N ha−1 would be released from organic N pools during the bermudagrass growing season (May to October). Because of similar temperature responses, it appeared that N release from mineralization would be synchronized with bermudagrass growth. Substantial bermudagrass growth in nonfertilized plots provided direct evidence that mineralization was a significant contributor to turf nutrition. There was no evidence that N fertilization or the ecology of the bermudagrass system posed inherent risks to water quality and the environment.",01 January 2003,Crop Science,"David J. Lee,Daniel C.

Then, based on the proposed algorithm, a relay-based traffic-aware energy-efficient routing protocol (R-TAEERP) with a weight function is proposed to offload the heavy consumption of the CHs. MATLAB simulations were accomplished to compare the performance of MH-PSOGSA and R-TAEERP with the existing representative protocols. The heterogeneity in energy and traffic has been considered. The simulation results show better performance of the proposed algorithm than other existing representative protocols in terms of energy consumption, the performance of the stable region, and the lifetime of the network.",18 May 2023,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Ehab H.

M-Connected Coverage Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.5402/2012/858021,none,Research Article,Wiley,,"Solving coverage problem alone is not adequate in a wireless sensor network, since data has to be transmitted to the base station. This leads to the lookout for an energy efficient method to solve connected coverage problem. This paper addresses M-connected (each sensor node will have at least M other sensor nodes within its communication range) target coverage problem in wireless sensor networks, where the required level of connectivity and coverage may be high or low as required. We propose a heuristic for M-connected target coverage problem, where initially a cover is decided and later on it is checked for M-connectivity. M-connectivity for simple coverage, k-coverage, and Q-coverage is focussed on in this paper. We use a Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) inspired model, where a cluster is considered as a set of sensor nodes satisfying M-connectivity and required level of coverage. It is enough if one among these nodes transmits the monitored information to the base station. When the required level of coverage are high, chances of nodes being connected in the cover is high.

A cluster-based fault-tolerant routing protocol for wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4131,5,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"CFTR,clustering,fault tolerance,routing,wireless sensor networks","Energy conservation and fault tolerance are two critical issues in the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many cluster-based fault-tolerant routing protocols have been proposed for energy conservation and network lifetime maximization in WSNs. However, these protocols suffer from high frequency of re-clustering as well as extra energy consumption to tolerate failures and consider only some very normal parameters to form clusters without any verification of the energy sufficiency for data routing. Therefore, this paper proposes a cluster-based fault-tolerant routing protocol referred as CFTR. This protocol allows higher energy nodes to become Cluster Heads (CHs) and operate multiple rounds to diminish the frequency of re-clustering. Additionally, for the sake to get better energy efficiency and balancing, we introduce a cost function that considers during cluster formation energy cost from sensor node to CH, energy cost from CH to sink, and another significant parameter, namely, number of cluster members in previous round. Further, the proposed CFTR takes care of nodes, which have no CH in their communication range. Also, it introduces a routing algorithm in which the decision of next hop CH selection is based on a cost function conceived to select routes with sufficient energy for data transfer and distribute uniformly the overall data-relaying load among the CHs. As well, a low-overhead algorithm to tolerate the sudden failure of CHs is proposed. We perform extensive simulations on CFTR and compare their results with those of two recent existing protocols to demonstrate its superiority in terms of different metrics.",13 September 2019,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Noureddine Moussa,Abdelbaki El Belrhiti El Alaoui,","(Computer Networks andSystems Laboratory Faculty of Sciences, Moulay Ismail University Meknes Morocco),(Computer Networks andSystems Laboratory Faculty of Sciences, Moulay Ismail University Meknes Morocco),","Morocco,Morocco"

Irrespective of network topology, the distribution of NRE is proven to approach Gaussian in dense node deployment. A decentralized clustering algorithm is present, using timers and a recursively updated probability to select nodes with more residual energy to become Cluster Head (CH) nodes and organize other nodes in the form of clusters over slotted time intervals. Embracing the dense node deployment, each node initializes its probability of becoming a CH node using the distribution of NRE defined in its neighborhood area. Each of the selected CH nodes resides in the center of its cluster area, which has a radius that can be arbitrarily chosen. The performances of the new clustering algorithm are analyzed and then validated via extensive simulations, taking into account variable cluster radius and variable network density.

Neural Network Clustering and Swarm Intelligence-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Machine Learning Perspective,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4758852,4,Research Article,Wiley,,"With no requirement for an established network infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are well suited for applications that call for quick network deployment. Military training and emergency rescue operations are two prominent uses of WSNs. The individual network nodes must carry out routing and intrusion detection because there is no predetermined routing or intrusion detection in a wireless network. WSNs can only manage a certain volume of data, and doing so requires a significant amount of energy to process, transmit, and receive. Since sensors have a modest energy source and a constrained bandwidth, they cannot transmit all of their data to a base station for processing and analysis. Therefore, machine learning (ML) techniques are needed for WSNs to facilitate data transmission. Other current solutions have drawbacks as well, such as being less reliable, more susceptible to environmental changes, converging more slowly, and having shorter network lifetimes. This study addressed problems with wireless sensor networks and devised an efficient clustering and routing algorithm based on machine learning. Results from simulations demonstrate that the proposed system beats previous state-of-the-art models on a variety of metrics, including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity (0.93, 0.93, and 0.92 respectively).",27 July 2023,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"Awatef Salem Balobaid,Saahira Banu Ahamed,Shermin Shamsudheen,S.

However, most of the existing distributed methods rely on locating systems, which consume more energy, and assume that sensors are uniformly distributed, which is clearly not applicable for the scenarios with nonuniform sensor distribution. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a big data storage and retrieval algorithm for WSNs with nonuniform node distribution, which aims at estimating the real distribution and the addresses of sensor nodes.

Disaster prediction systems are essential tools for enhancing public safety, reducing the impact of disasters, and enabling more informed and strategic decision-making across various sectors. Their development and implementation represent a crucial aspect of modern disaster risk management and resilience systems. This novel technique introduces a modern approach to forest fire prediction by integrating a deep learning model with an optimized cluster head selection technique. The major goal is to augment the accuracy and efficiency of forest fire prediction, leveraging the capabilities of advanced machine learning algorithms and optimized sensor network management. The proposed system comprises two core components: a deep learning model for predictive analysis and an optimized selection process for cluster heads in sensor networks. The deep learning model utilizes various environmental data parameters such as humidity, wind speed, temperature and former fire incidents. These parameters are processed through a sophisticated neural network architecture designed to identify patterns and correlations that signify the likelihood of a forest fire. The model is trained on historical data to improve its predictive accuracy, and its performance is continuously evaluated against new data. Simultaneously, the optimized cluster head selection using the cat-mouse optimization technique plays a crucial role in efficiently managing sensor networks deployed in forests. The integration of these two components results in a robust system capable of predicting forest fires with high precision.

Quality of Service aware secure data transmission model for Internet of Things assisted wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.4664,1,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the most critical networks in developing various Internet of Things (IoT) based applications. However, such intelligent devices have drawbacks for energy, memory, processing, and computation resources. In addition, achieving Quality of Service (QoS) with secure data transmission (DT) is a significant challenge for WSNs. This article proposes efficient IoT authentication and energy-aware safe DT models for achieving better QoS and security with lower energy consumption (EC) in WSNs. Initially, the network randomly deploys the sensor nodes (SNs) and performs the registration of the SNs with the base station (BS). Second, the Entropy-based Jaccard similarity induced fuzzy C-means clustering (EJS-FCM) model clusters the SNs based on the intrinsic qualities of nodes. Then the boosted grasshopper optimization algorithm (BGOA) selects the cluster heads (CHs) optimally by considering major fitness parameters such as communication distance, energy, and distance centroid. Following that, an Adler-32 hashing-based authentication scheme performs authentication of every IoT node deployed in the network to provide safer DT. After successful authentication, secure hash elliptical curve cryptography (SHECC) encrypts the data collected from the CHs by incorporating a hashing function both in encryption and decryption, enhancing the IoT data's security level. Finally, in a cloud server (CS), the decentralized blockchain (BC) stores the encrypted data and the authentication credentials of the IoT devices from the BS, which provide additional security to the network. The results of the presented model show its performance efficiency over existing approaches for energy efficiency (EE), QoS, and security.",17 October 2022,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,"P.

However, previously understudied differences among AFS may underestimate their climate change mitigation potential. In this 3-year field study, we assessed various C stocks and greenhouse gas emissions across two common AFS (hedgerows and shelterbelts) and their component land uses: perennial vegetated areas with and without trees (woodland and grassland, respectively), newly planted saplings in grassland, and adjacent annual cropland in central Alberta, Canada. Between 2018 and 2020 (~April–October), nitrous oxide emissions were 89% lower under perennial vegetation relative to the cropland (0.02 and 0.18 g N m−2 year−1, respectively). In 2020, heterotrophic respiration in the woodland was 53% lower in shelterbelts relative to hedgerows (279 and 600 g C m−2 year−1, respectively). Within the woodland, deadwood C stock was particularly important in hedgerows (35 Mg C ha−1 or 7% of ecosystem C) relative to shelterbelts (2 Mg C ha−1 or <1% of ecosystem C), and likely affected C cycling differences between the woodland types by enhancing soil labile C and microbial biomass in hedgerows. Deadwood C stock was positively correlated with annual heterotrophic respiration and total (to ~100 cm depth) soil organic C, water-soluble organic C, and microbial biomass C. Total ecosystem C was 1.90–2.55 times greater within the woodland than all other land uses, with 176, 234, 237, and 449 Mg C ha−1 found in the cropland, grassland, planted saplings treatment, and woodland, respectively. Shelterbelt and hedgerow woodlands contained 2.09 and 3.03 times more C, respectively, than adjacent cropland.

An unequal clustering algorithm based on energy balance for wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tee.21747,4,Paper,Wiley,"clustering,lifetime of cluster head nodes,dissipation energy,energy balance","Sensor nodes in sensor networks often gather data and deliver them to the sink. However, the energy and radio range constraints force them to cooperate in transmitting the data to the destination with multihop communication. To achieve this, nodes have to be clustered and some of them are elected as the cluster head nodes to transmit the aggregated data. Unfortunately, the clustering brings extra traffic load to the cluster head nodes, particularly those closer to the sink. These nodes die faster than before as their energy is drained at a high rate. Therefore, some clustering and cluster head election algorithms were suggested to use the unequal clustering size to extend the lifetime of cluster head nodes. However, it is difficult to obtain the accurate cluster size in the process of unequal clustering. Moreover, some cluster head nodes with the overfull cluster members may die early. We propose an enhanced unequal clustering size algorithm to optimize the unequal cluster size in the different layers and balance the dissipation energy of all cluster head nodes. Simulation results show that our algorithm dissipates approximately the same energy of cluster head nodes in the different layers per round and obviously increases the number of rounds of data gathering and transmission. © 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

It consists of a series of tags and readers which collect a huge number of redundant data. It increases system overhead and decreases overall network lifetime. Existing solutions like Time-Distance Bloom Filter (TDBF) algorithm are inapplicable to the large-scale environment. Received Signal Strength (RSS) used in this algorithm is highly dependent on quality of tag and application environment. In this paper, we propose an approach for data redundancy minimization for RFID surveillance data which is a modified version of TDBF. The proposed algorithm is formulated by using the observed time and calculated distance of RFID tags. To overcome these problems, we design our approach to relevantly reduce the spatiotemporal data redundancy in the source level by adding the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) concept for energy-efficient RFID data communication in wireless sensor network scenario. We introduce in this paper the new improved idea of an existing algorithm which efficiently reduces the rate of data redundancy spatially and temporally.

The existing clustering algorithms do not consider the optimal selection of the cluster head resulting in low survival rates and high energy consumption rates in nodes. The adaptive clustering is required in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based sophisticated networks where seamless connectivity is imperative for rapid communication. In order to meet this research gap, an adaptive clustering algorithm for mobile opportunistic networks is proposed within military bases that uses a heuristic algorithm (GA) for adaptive clustering. An analysis of the opportunity network at the connected military base is carried out and the mobile opportunity model is constructed using the adaptive clustering for the similar traffic.

A LEACH clustering protocol enables communication between cluster heads and base stations based on single-hop and multihop cluster nodes.

The Internet of Things (IoT) allows physically existing things to see, hear, think, and perform a significant task by allowing them to interact with one another and exchange valuable knowledge when making decisions and caring out their vital tasks. The fifth-generation (5G) communications require that the Internet of Things (IoT) is aided greatly by wireless sensor networks, which serve as a permanent layer for it. A wireless sensor network comprises a collection of sensor nodes to monitor and transmit data to the destination known as the sink. The sink (or base station) is the endpoint of data transmission in every round. The major concerns of IoT-based WSNs are improving the network lifetime and energy efficiency. In the proposed system, Optimal Cluster-Based Routing (Optimal-CBR), the energy efficiency, and network lifetime are improved using a hierarchical routing approach for applications on the IoT in the 5G environment and beyond. The Optimal-CBR protocol uses the k-means algorithm for clustering the nodes and the multihop approach for chain routing. The clustering phase is invoked until two-thirds of the nodes are dead and then the chaining phase is invoked for the rest of the data transmission. The nodes are clustered using the basic k-means algorithm during the cluster phase and the highest energy of the node nearest to the centroid is selected as the cluster head (CH). The CH collects the packets from its members and forwards them to the base station (BS). During the chaining phase, since two-thirds of the nodes are dead and the residual energy is insufficient for clustering, the remaining nodes perform multihop routing to create chaining until the data are transmitted to the BS.

Energy and throughput efficient mobile wireless sensor networks: A deep reinforcement learning approach,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ntw2.12126,none,ORIGINAL RESEARCH,Wiley,"energy consumption,learning (artificial intelligence),mobile ad hoc networks,routing protocols,wireless sensor networks","The efficient development of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) relies heavily on optimizing two key parameters: Throughput and Energy Consumption. The proposed work investigates network connectivity issues with MWSN and proposes two routing algorithms, namely Self-Organising Maps based-Optimised Link State Routing (SOM-OLSR) and Deep Reinforcement Learning based-Optimised Link State Routing (DRL-OLSR) for MWSNs. The primary objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve energy-efficient routing while maximizing throughput. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through simulations by considering various performance metrics, including connection probability (CP), end-to-end delay, overhead, network throughput, and energy consumption. The simulation analysis is discussed under three scenarios. The first scenario undertakes ‘no optimisation’, the second considers SOM-OLSR, and the third undertakes DRL-OLSR. A comparison between DRL-OLSR and SOM-OLSR reveals that the former surpasses the latter in terms of low latency and prolonged network lifetime. Specifically, DRL-OLSR demonstrates a 47% increase in throughput, a 67% reduction in energy consumption, and a CP three times higher than SOM-OLSR. Furthermore, when contrasted with the ‘no optimisation’ scenario, DRL-OLSR achieves a remarkable 69.7% higher throughput and nearly 89% lower energy consumption.

Enhanced Route Discovery Mechanism Using Improved CH Selection Using Q-Learning to Minimize Delay,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/3187858,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"With the technological advancements, practical challenges of establishing long-distance communication should be addressed using hop-oriented routing networks. However, long-distance data transmissions usually deteriorate the quality of service (QoS) especially in terms of considerable communication delay. Therefore, in the presented work, a reward-based routing mechanism is proposed that aims at minimizing the overall delay which is evaluated under various scenarios. The routing process involved a refined CH selection mechanism based on a mathematical model until a threshold simulation is not attained. The illustrations for the coverage calculations of CH in the route discovery are also provided for possible routes between the source and the destination to deliver quality service. Based on this information, the data gathered from the past simulations is passed to the learning mechanism using the Q-learning model. The work is evaluated in terms of throughput, PDR, and first dead node in order to achieve minimal transmission delay. Furthermore, area variation is also involved to investigate the effect of an increase in the deployment area and number of nodes on a Q-learning-based mechanism aimed to minimize the delay.

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) consist of a collection of autonomous mobile nodes that can form an ad hoc network in the absence of any pre-existing infrastructure. System performance may suffer due to the changeable topology of MANETs. Since most mobile hosts operate on limited battery power, energy consumption poses the biggest challenge for MANETs. Both network lifetime and throughput improve when energy usage is reduced. However, existing approaches perform poorly in terms of energy efficiency. Scalability becomes a significant issue in large-scale networks as they grow, leading to overhead associated with routing updates and maintenance that can become unmanageable. This article employs a MANET routing protocol combined with an energy conservation strategy. The clustering hierarchy is used in MANETs to maximize the network's lifespan, considering its limited energy resources. In the MANET communication process, the cluster head (CH) is selected using Fire Hawk Optimization (FHO). When choosing nodes to act as a cluster for an extended period, CH election factors in connectivity, mobility, and remaining energy. This process is achieved using an optimized version of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, utilizing Improved Chicken Swarm Optimization (ICSO).

Coverage and clustering techniques enable the sensor network to operate in group-based and region-based communication and thus save the node energy. Energy-efficient protocols save the node energy and increase the network life cycle in a resource-constrained sensor network. Cluster head (CH) node manages and controls the operations such as network topology, coverage area, and routing paths (multi-paths and fault-tolerant paths) of the network. In this paper, we present deterministic K-means secure coverage clustering (K-SCC) with periodic authentication. The proposed protocol uses coverage clustering technique with periodic authentication between the CH node and sensor nodes to establish the secure channel in the network. Maximum cover of K nodes is maintained in the secure coverage cluster to achieve authenticated communication between the sensor nodes in the network. The proposed K-SCC protocol is compared with the existing protocols such as deterministic-SCC and random-SCC protocols. Simulation results indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol achieves an average of 84% coverage ratio (cluster/sensor node ratio) as compared with 62% coverage ratio in the existing SCC protocols. Simulations also indicate that the proposed K-SCC protocol consumes 20% less energy as compared with the existing SCC protocol.

Because they transmit their packet and forward the outer sub-regions packet to the sink. Hence, a hole arises near the sink node after a very short time. Thus, an energy-aware optimal routing model is introduced in this research using Modified Voronoi-assisted prioritized double deep Q-learning (PDDQL). Initially, the sensor nodes are deployed using the Voronoi cell structure that splits the entire region of interest into different Voronoi polygons. However, the Voronoi diagram will not always predict an efficient route because of the nodes at a Voronoi edge or vertex outside the transmission range. To tackle this issue, a new Voronoi diagram is proposed that depends on the maximum horizontal transmission range to remove the portion of Voronoi edges uncovered by the sensor node. After the deployment, a PDDQL algorithm is used to select the Relay Nodes based on their remaining energy. The proposed PDDQL determines an alternate route to transmit the packet if an energy hole problem has occurred in WMSN.

More specifically, in EDB-CHS protocol, a new cluster shape is proposed and consequently a tight closed-form expression for the optimal number of cluster heads (CHs) in the network is derived. Additionally, an efficacious CHS algorithm is presented, which is an expression of threshold probability that takes into account the residual energy of sensor nodes, how far they are located from the Base Station (BS), as well as the node's optimal probability of being a CH.

Optimal Relay Angle-Based Clustering Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/5751155,none,Research Article,Wiley,,"In this paper, a novel optimal relay angle-based clustering routing protocol called RACR is proposed to balance nodes’ energy consumption and prolong the network lifespan of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In RACR, each node considers the parameters residual energy, number of neighbors, and average distance with neighbors as a criteria to determine whether to become a cluster head (CH) which cooperates with its neighbors to form a cluster. Afterward, the optimal relay angle is calculated for each CH to find its best relay node according to a target function considering the least energy consumption, which is applied to reduce the search range for finding routing paths. Consequently, all the CHs can find their best next-hop nodes within the determined field according to their residual energy, distance to the next-hop CH, and loads. Iteratively, the CHs obtain their best routing paths to the BS in the end. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness of RACR in terms of energy consumption, standard deviation of residual energy, data communication delay, network throughput, and lifespan.",20 June 2022,Journal of Sensors,"Huangshui Hu,Yuxin Guo,Chuhang Wang,Dong Gao,Qinxue Liu,","(College of Computer and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, 130012, China ccut.edu.cn),(College of Computer and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, 130012, China ccut.edu.cn),(College of Computer and Science, Changchun Normal University, 130032, China cncnc.edu.cn),(College of Computer and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, 130012, China ccut.edu.cn),(College of Computer and Engineering, Jilin University of Architecture and Technology, 130114, China),","China,China,China,China,China"

Because of the resource constraint, type-variant and battery-powered features of the sensor nodes, the key challenge is how to improve the energy usage and network life in the heterogeneous sensor networks. In this paper, the Mahalanobis distance based K-Means algorithm is integrated with a novel evolutionary approach for clustering called calf search optimization algorithm (K-CSOA) that creates energy efficient clusters. The routing in the network is performed using a power efficient ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO). The extensive and multiple simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is observed that the running time of the proposed scheme is lowered due to the implementation of hybrid clustering. The results are validated for various performance metrics wherein the proposed method shows 41.6% and 4.3%–12% reduction in energy expenditure and end-to-end delay respectively and around 60% enhancement in the throughput of the network when compared with other similar state-of-the-art methods.

Analysis and Design of a Wireless Sensor Network Based on the Residual Energy of the Nodes and the Harvested Energy from Mint Plants,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/6655967,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"Nowadays, the use of sensor nodes for the IoT is widespread; nodes that compose these networks must possess self-organizing capabilities and communication protocols that require less energy consumption during communication procedures. In this work, we propose the design and analysis of an energy harvesting system using bioelectricity harvested from mint plants that aids in powering a particular design of a wireless sensor operating in a continuous monitoring mode. The system is based on randomly turning nodes ON (active nodes) and OFF (inactive nodes) to avoid their energy depletion. While a node is in an inactive state, it is allowed to harvest energy from the surroundings. However, while the node is harvesting energy from its surroundings, it is unable to report data. As such, a clear compromise is established between the amount of information reported and the lifetime of the network. To finely tune the system’s parameters and offer an adequate operation, we derive a mathematical model based on a discrete Markov chain that describes the main dynamics of the system. We observe that with the use of mint plants, the harvested energy is of the order of a few Joules; nonetheless, such small energy values can sustain a wireless transmission if correctly adapted to drive a wireless sensor. If we consider the lowest mean harvested energy obtained from mint plants, such energy can be used to transmit up to 259,564 bits or can also be used to receive up to 301,036 bits. On the other hand, if we consider the greatest mean harvested energy, this energy can be used to transmit up to 2,394,737 bits or can also be used to receive up to 2,777,349 bits.",02 March 2021,Journal of Sensors,"Hassel Aurora Alcalá-Garrido,Víctor Barrera-Figueroa,Mario E.

Clustering-based power-controlled routing for mobile wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.1280,67,Research Article,Wiley,"clustering,variable transmission power,mobile sensor networks,distributed routing protocol","This paper presents two new routing protocols for mobile sensor networks, viz. power-controlled routing (PCR) and its enhanced version, i.e. Enhanced Power-Controlled Routing (EPCR). In both the protocols, fixed transmission power is employed in the clustering phase but when ordinary nodes are about to send their data to their respective cluster-heads, they change their transmission power according to their distance from their cluster-head. While in PCR, the nodes are associated with the cluster-head on the basis of weight, in EPCR it is done on the basis of distance. In addition to the protocols, we are suggesting a packet loss recovery mechanism for the PCR and EPCR. Both protocols work well for both mobile and static networks and are designed to achieve high network lifetime, high packet delivery ratio, and high network throughput. These protocols are extensively simulated using mass mobility model, with different speeds and different number of nodes to evaluate their performance. Simulation results show that both PCR and EPCR are successful in achieving their objectives by using variable transmission powers and smart clustering.

The top level algorithm is a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) whose goal is to obtain clustering schemes in which the network lifetime is optimized for different delay values. The low level GA is used in each cluster in order to get the most efficient topology for data transmission from sensor nodes to the cluster head. The presented clustering method is not restrictive, whereas existing intelligent clustering methods impose certain conditions such as performing two-tiered clustering. A random deployed model is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In addition, a comparison is made between the presented algorithm other GA-based clustering methods and the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy protocol.

Wireless energy harvesting is suggested in the proposed three-layer cluster-based wireless sensor network routing protocol to extend the energy lifespan of the network. For the purpose of recognising and blacklisting risky sensor node behaviour, a three-tier clustering architecture with an integrated security mechanism is suggested.

The main focus of this research is identifying the unstable cluster heads and replacing them with other nodes that implement the self-configurable cluster method. For defining the cluster heads successfully, we presented a k-means protocol approach.

Distributed topology management for wireless multimedia sensor networks: exploiting connectivity and cooperation,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.2770,26,Research Article,Wiley,"topology management,multimedia sensor networks,connectivity,cooperation","In this paper, we propose a distributed topology management algorithm, named T-Must, which orchestrates coalition formation game between camera and scalar sensor (SS) nodes, for use in wireless multimedia sensor networks. In the proposed solution, connectivity among the peer camera sensor (CS) nodes is maintained, and coverage is ensured between them. Only the scalar data are not sufficient to describe an event in a particular monitored area. In many cases, multimedia data (specifically, video data) are required to provide more precise information about the event. As the CS nodes, which sense and transmit multimedia data, are costlier than the SS nodes, the former are deployed in the monitored area in lesser numbers compared to the latter ones. In case of CS nodes, power consumption due to sensing is also significant, similar to power consumption for the transmission and reception of packets. Therefore, in this work, in order to increase the network lifetime, topology is controlled by forming coalition between the CS and SS nodes. Upon occurrence of an event, the SS nodes send scalar data to their associated CS nodes. If the scalar data received from SS nodes cross a preconfigured threshold, the associated CS node in the coalition starts sensing the event, captures the video data, and forwards the video data toward other coalitions or sink.

Metaheuristic Load-Balancing-Based Clustering Technique in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/8911651,6,Research Article,Wiley,,"The resource-constrained nature of wireless sensor networks engenders the development of energy-efficient network operations. To mitigate the prime concern of developing an energy-efficient network, clustering of the nodes has emerged as a very effective tool. If executed intelligently, clustering can not only help in obtaining even load distribution among the network nodes but also help in having the enhanced network lifetime and scalability. In this work, a Metaheuristic Load-Balancing-Based Clustering Technique (MLBCT) in wireless sensor networks has been proposed which formulates the energy-balanced clusters based on the differential evolution technique to improve the network lifetime. To ensure the formation of balanced clusters, several metrics like nodes’ proximity, nodes’ distribution, and energy distribution across the sensing field have been considered. Moreover, to facilitate the even load distribution among the cluster members, a randomized rotation of cluster head is implemented. The supremacy of the proposed scheme is confirmed through an extensive set of simulations against the state-of-art schemes. Simulation results reflect an average gain of 51.85% in network lifetime under the variable network configurations in an ideal environment.

Designing an efficient, low-energy, and fault-tolerant routing protocol for the frequently changing topology of highly mobile MWSNs is challenging. Most routing protocols today only support the movement of sensor nodes or only sink. This paper proposes a Multiple Mobile Sinks Coverage Maximization based hierarchical routing protocol for mobile wireless sensor networks (MMSCM), which allows sensor nodes and sinks to move simultaneously. The MMSCM divides the monitoring area into virtual grids and deploys a movable sink in each grid cell. Sink selects the appropriate next hop for each cluster head in the area to build an optimal routing forest and collects data from all routing tree root nodes at a uniform speed along the specified path with maximum coverage. Simulation results show that, compared with current advanced routing algorithms, the MMSCM protocol can better solve the network delay problem and improve data throughput while extending the network life cycle, which is more suitable for time-sensitive application scenarios.",20 April 2023,IET Communications,"Chun Liu,Liping Guo,","(College of Computer Science Hubei University of Technology Wuhan China),(College of Computer Science Hubei University of Technology Wuhan China),","China,China,China"

Delay in visiting all the nodes is addressed through the rendezvous points that collect the data from other nodes such that the nodes collect the data from this point rather than visiting all the nodes, which saves energy. However, the optimal placement of the mobile sinks to visit those rendezvous points is a need, which is addressed optimally using the proposed fractional rider optimization algorithm (FROA). The FROA is the modification of the rider optimization algorithm (ROA) with the fractional theory, and the ultimate goal of the proposed algorithm is to optimally place the mobile sink for which initially, the wireless sensor environment is split as uniform-sized cells with the Voronoi partitions and clusters are formed using sparse fuzzy c-means (sparse-FCM) algorithm. The constraints for enabling the optimal sink placement are distance, delay, and energy of the nodes.

The deployment of VANET relies on routing protocols to transmit the information between the nodes. Different routing protocols that have been designed for MANET were proposed to be applied in VANET. However, the real-time implementation is still facing challenges to fulfill the quality of service (QoS) of VANET. Therefore, this study mainly focuses on the well-known MANET proactive optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. The OLSR in VANET gives a moderate performance; this is due to its necessity of maintaining an updated routing table for all possible routes. The performance of OLSR is highly dependent on its parameter. Thus, finding optimal parameter configurations that best fit VANET features and improve its quality of services is essential before its deployment. The harmony search (HS) is an emerging metaheuristic optimization algorithm with features of simplicity and exploration efficiency. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an improved harmony search optimization (EHSO) algorithm that considers the configuration of the OLSR parameters by coupling two stages, a procedure for optimization carried out by the EHSO algorithm based on embedding two popular selection methods in its memory, namely, roulette wheel selection and tournament selection.

Another reason for data fusion is that, in many applications, only some of the data that are collected can meet the requirements of the sink node. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate the number of cluster heads or data aggregators during data fusion based on the rate-distortion function. In our discussion, we will first establish an energy consumption model and then describe a method for calculating the number of cluster heads from the point of view of reducing energy consumption.

Most wireless sensor network protocols have become inefficient in EHWSN due to neglecting the energy harvesting property.

It takes the node’s information such as local energy state, local density, and remote degree into account and uses fuzzy logic to conduct the cluster head selection and cluster size allocation. Meanwhile, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a reinforcement learning strategy is utilized by CPEH to discover a highly efficient intercluster routing between cluster heads and the base station.

In this paper, several existing WBAN routing methods are presented which are influenced by network structure, energy, quality of service (QoS), node temperature, human position, node transmission range, and other factors. The protocols, including cross-layered, cluster-based, QoS-aware, postural movement-based, temperature-aware, postural movement-based, and routing protocols, are given in an expressive taxonomy. Different routing protocols that have already been developed for WBANs are compared with more advanced protocols. The pros and cons of each protocol are looked at based on factors like delay, packet delivery ratio, and energy use. The researchers can utilize this survey paper as a reference for studying various routing protocols particularly in the medical and healthcare systems.",17 January 2023,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Reema Goyal,Nitin Mittal,Lipika Gupta,Amit Surana,","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chandigarh University, Mohali, India chandigarhuniversity.ac.in),(University Centre for Research and Development, Chandigarh University, Mohali, India chandigarhuniversity.ac.in),(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Chitkara University, Punjab 140401, India chitkara.edu.in),(Department of Electronics and Communication, Eastern College of Engineering, Biratnagar, Nepal),","India,India,India,Nepal"

Thus, recently, many researchers have paid attention to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The limitation of energy is critical since most sensors are battery-powered and it is very difficult to replace batteries in cases that sensor networks are utilized outdoors. Data transmission between sensor nodes needs more energy than computation in a sensor node. In order to reduce the energy consumption of sensors, we present an approximate data gathering technique, called CMOS, based on the Kalman filter. The goal of CMOS is to efficiently obtain the sensor readings within a certain error bound. In our approach, spatially close sensors are grouped as a cluster. Since a cluster header generates approximate readings of member nodes, a user query can be answered efficiently using the cluster headers. In addition, we suggest an energy efficient clustering method to distribute the energy consumption of cluster headers.

Node defect detection is a core technology of WSN and is essential for most WSN networks. The defective node reduces the overall service quality (OSQ) of the global WSN network system. Therefore, a type II fuzzy inference system (T2_FIS) is proposed for detecting defective nodes in the WSN network. The adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and proposed method are introduced for tuning the parameters in the T2_FIS system. The proposed T2_FIS method effectively detects the broken node in the WSN network using the fuzzy rules. In addition, the improved Mud Ring (IMR) optimization algorithm is proposed to replace the faulty node with the neighborhood node in the network. The defective nodes are identified and replaced with the closest nodes based on the membership function (MF) generated by the T2_FIS.

WSNs' feature spectrum is greatly expanded by the mobility of nodes introduced by MWSNs. MWSN is a network with lots of sensors that are initially distributed randomly and collaborate to gather, process, and transmit information around targets to the sink node. MWSN is an overgrowth and emerging technology with significant applications that provide free moving for sensors and adaptable communicating with each other without fixed infrastructure. Because of their small size, they have limited radio capability, storage, and power. Therefore, MWSNs are utilized to improve network lifetime, energy expenditure, and channel capacity than fixed WSNs. Many routing protocols have recently been introduced to perform advances in the field of energy expenditure for MWSN data collection. This paper introduces a survey on hierarchical-based routing protocols for MWSNs. The survey outlines the classification of the routing techniques in the aspect of mobility.

However, the collected or reported information might be falsified by faults or malicious nodes. Hence, identifying malicious nodes in an effective and timely manner is essential for the network to function properly and reliably. Maliciously behaving nodes are usually detected and isolated by reputation and trust-based schemes before they can damage the network. In this paper, we propose an efficient weighted trust-based malicious node detection (WT-MND) scheme that can detect malicious nodes in a clustered WSN. The node behaviors are realistically treated by accounting for false-positive and false-negative instances. The simulation results confirm the timely identification and isolation of maliciously behaving nodes by the WT-MND scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is afforded by the adaptive trust-update process, which implicitly performs trust recovery of temporarily malfunctioning nodes and computes a different trust-update factor for each node depending on its behavior. The proposed scheme is more effective and scalable than the related schemes in the literature, as evidenced by its higher detection ratio (DR) and lower misdetection ratio (MDR), which only slightly vary with the network's size.

It is, thus, of uttermost importance to monitor the strain condition of critical structures, so as to prevent catastrophic failures, but also to minimize maintenance costs. In order to overcome limitations of existing conventional strain sensors, including extensive cabling arrangement and continuous power supply, a newly dual-interrogation-mode radio frequency identification (RFID) strain sensor is proposed in this study to achieve a longer interrogation transmission distance for wireless strain sensing, which can automatically switch between passive modes with low power consumption and active modes with ultra-high frequency (UHF). The proposed design scheme involves the RFID tag and RFID reader for wireless strain transmission module and the improved Wheatstone bridge as strain measurement module. The proposed RFID strain sensor features the following merits: (i) Wireless strain sensing characteristics with the integration of RFID technology. (ii) Long transmission distance with dual interrogation mode: RFID tag is generally in a passive dormant state with an extremely low operating current.

Blockchain-Based Key Management and Green Routing Scheme for Vehicular Named Data Networking,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/3717702,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"Due to the distributed and dynamic characteristics of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the continuous growth in the number of devices, content-centric decentralized vehicular named data networking (VNDN) has become more suitable for content-oriented applications in IoV. However, the existing centralized architecture is prone to the failure of single points, which results in trust problems in key verification between cross-domain nodes and consuming more power and reducing the lifetime. Focusing on secure key management and power-efficient routing, this article proposes a blockchain-based key management and green routing scheme for VNDN. A blockchain-based key management scheme is presented to achieve secure and efficient distribution and verification of keys. Specifically, all trusted agencies (TAs) form a consortium blockchain for storing public key hashes to ensure the authenticity of users’ public keys. A green global routing scheme based on node relaying pressure (GGNRP) is proposed to save power consumption and reduce the forwarding delay. A new node relay pressure metric is introduced to assist with routing decisions. Detailed experiments and analysis show that, compared with the existing scheme, the proposed scheme can achieve secure key management and GGNRP can decrease the power consumption and average delay by 15.8% and 63.2%, respectively.",08 July 2021,Security and Communication Networks,"Hao Liu,Rongbo Zhu,Jun Wang,Wengang Xu,","(College of Computer Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China scuec.edu.cn),(College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China hzau.edu.cn),(College of Computer Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China scuec.edu.cn),(College of Computer Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China scuec.edu.cn),","China,China,China,China"

Negative association in uniform forests and connected graphs,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rsa.20012,15,,Wiley,"negative association,uniform forest,uniform spanning tree,uniform connected graph","We consider three probability measures on subsets of edges of a given finite graph G, namely, those which govern, respectively, a uniform forest, a uniform spanning tree, and a uniform connected subgraph. A conjecture concerning the negative association of two edges is reviewed for a uniform forest, and a related conjecture is posed for a uniform connected subgraph. The former conjecture is verified numerically for all graphs G having eight or fewer vertices, or having nine vertices and no more than 18 edges, using a certain computer algorithm which is summarized in this paper. Negative association is known already to be valid for a uniform spanning tree.

Energy-efficient data transmission in PA via sensing technology is possible only when additional security measures are synchronized. Nevertheless, security considerations often introduce additional overhead. Thus, it is necessary to develop an efficient mechanism to achieve an optimal trade-off between security and resource efficiency. The prime purpose of the proposed study is to introduce a lightweight communication protocol that can ensure an adequate balance between energy efficiency and maximum-security demands to benefit the success of PA. This paper proposes a synchronized framework where unique public-key encryption has been used, unlike any existing approach to facilitate the participation of legitimate on-field sensors in PA. On the other hand, an algorithm for energy efficiency where unique structural management of routing is discussed concerning aggregator nodes. In contrast, the security algorithm discusses a uniquely progressive and noniterative mechanism to perform secure data aggregation with a parallel validation technique. The proposed logic is scripted in MATLAB, considering a suitable PA environment where comparative assessment is carried out on a uniform testbed.

Effect of fading on the k-coverage of wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.3994,5,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,,"In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), coverage performance of the network is affected by multiple factors such as source power, sensitivity of sensors, and the quality of the channel between the source and the sensors. In most existing works on WSNs, only path-loss of the wireless channel is considered, that with further assumption of absence of obstacles in the sensing region of a sensor, results in circular-type of coverage for each node. However, in some WSN applications, the channel is not line-of-sight and exhibits multipath fading. In this paper, effect of the multipath fading on k-coverage of randomly deployed WSNs is analytically investigated via techniques from stochastic geometry. More specifically, the k-coverage probability is analytically derived under Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami fading assumptions. Numerical results are also presented to compare the derived k-coverage probability with the commonly used k-coverage models that do not consider the fading effect. These results reveal the level of the k-coverage degradation due to multipath fading compared to the case of no fading (fixed range), which in some cases is shown to be very significant.",16 June 2020,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,"Amir Hosein

In order to tackle the coverage and connectivity problems, we have proposed a hybrid optimization-based model. Thereby, the target-based WSNs can include the sensor nodes which are placed based on determining minimum number of selected potential positions. To do that, an optimization approach based on a hybrid tunicate swarm optimizer (TSO) and salp swarm optimizer (SSO) is proposed for coverage and connectivity problems in WSNs. Feature exploitation ability of SSO is improved by TSO operators, because these operators can act as local search operators. Basically, these hybrid algorithm operators are used to derive the fitness function followed with the solution representation step. Initially, the population is generated, and the hybrid tunicate swarm optimizer and salp swarm optimizer (HTSS) algorithm has updated the solutions in the next subsequent step. Ultimately, the nondominated solutions are determined in the final step. The two different scenarios of WSN are used for simulation of this scheme.

However, recent applications and new multimedia sensors have increased the demand for a more adequate management of their quality of service (QoS). The constraints and demands for this QoS management greatly depend on each individual network’s purpose or application. Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is arguably the most well-known routing protocol for WSNs, but it is not QoS-aware. In this paper, we propose LEACH-APP, a new clustering protocol based on LEACH that takes the network’s application into account and is aimed at providing a better overall QoS management. We thoroughly describe our proposal and provide a case study to explain its operation. Then, we evaluate its performance in terms of two significant QoS metrics—throughput and latency—and compare it to that of the original protocol. Our experiments show that LEACH-APP increases the throughput by roughly 250% and reduces the latency by almost 80%, overall providing a more flexible and powerful QoS management.",02 September 2019,Journal of Sensors,"Alba Rozas,Alvaro Araujo,","(B105 Electronic Systems Lab, Department of Electronic Engineering, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación (ETSIT), Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), Av.

We calculate the importance value of all features of high-dimensional data and calculate the mean value by constructing random forest. The features whose importance value is less than 10% of the mean value are removed. At this time, we extract the important features to form a new dataset. At this time, improved t-SNE is used for dimension reduction, and better performance will be obtained. This method uses t-SNE that is improved by the idea of random forest to reduce the dimension of the original data and combines with improved FDP to compose the new clustering method.

We first propose an efficient cluster-based scheme named “Cuckoo-search Clustering with Two-hop Routing Tree (CC-TRT)” to develop a two-hop load-balanced data aggregation routing tree in the network. CC-TRT uses a modified energy-aware cuckoo-search algorithm to fairly select the best cluster head (CH) for each cluster. The applied cuckoo-search algorithm makes the CH role to rotate between different sensors round by round. Subsequently, we extend the CC-TRT scheme to present two methods for constructing multi-hop data aggregation routing trees, named “Cuckoo-search Clustering with Multi-Hop Routing Tree (CC-MRT)” and “Cuckoo-search Clustering with Weighted Multi-hop Routing Tree (CC-WMRT).” Both CC-MRT and CC-WMRT rely on a two-level structure; they not only use an energy-aware cuckoo-search algorithm to fairly select the best CHs but also adopt a load-balanced high-level routing tree to route the aggregated data of CHs to the sink node.

Review of Sensor Network-Based Irrigation Systems Using IoT and Remote Sensing,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/8396164,35,Review Article,Wiley,,"The motivation for this review paper came from the developing countries where the economy is mostly dependent on agriculture and climate conditions. Based on current conditions and historical records, profitability in production farming depends on making a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each field while preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the development of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in the world can display them through an internet-enabled device. Development of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-effective and potentially productive and increases the efficiency through precision agriculture farming. Different limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed publications like the shortage of power in the field that can be solved by using a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same time using electricity. Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design system optimization.

A UAV-Aided Cluster Head Election Framework and Applying Such to Security-Driven Cluster Head Election Schemes: A Survey,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/6475927,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) are now drawing a lot of attention from academic and research fields as well as the general public. The UAS is expected to provide many promising applications such as intelligent transportation system, disaster management, search and rescue, public safety, smart delivery, wild species monitoring, and wireless service area extension. More specifically, as a part of the wireless service extension, we deal with the information dissemination and collection using a UAV in this paper. In this application, because the UAV communicates with each CH (Cluster Head) to collect data from sensor nodes or to disseminate information to the sensor nodes, well-behaved and qualified nodes should be elected as CHs and their integrity should be preserved. Even though a UAV makes the information dissemination and collection process efficient in a WSN, we can make the UAV help the election of new CHs to mitigate the threat of compromised CHs. To this aim, we first propose a UAV-aided CH election framework where a UAV delivers the critical information collected from sensors to the sink, and the sink reselects a set of well-behaved and qualified CHs considering the information. Then, we classify the existing security-driven CH election schemes into several categories and explain the principle of each category and its representative schemes. For each representative scheme, we also explain how to adapt it into the UAV-aided CH election framework. Next, we identify some desirable security properties that a CH election scheme should provide and reveal the security level that each representative scheme reaches for the desirable security properties.

Scheduling sensor activity for information coverage of discrete targets in sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcm.626,3,Research Article,Wiley,"sensor activity scheduling,information coverage,sensing disk coverage,information covers,wireless sensor networks","In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling sensor activity to cover a set of targets with known locations such that all targets can be monitored all the time and the network can operate as long as possible. A solution to this scheduling problem is to partition all sensors into some sensor covers such that each cover can monitor all targets and the covers are activated sequentially. In this paper, we propose to provide information coverage instead of the conventional sensing disk coverage for target. The notion of information coverage is based on estimation theory to exploit the collaborative nature of geographically distributed sensors. Due to the use of information coverage, a target that is not within the sensing disk of any single sensor can still be considered to be monitored (information covered) by the cooperation of more than one sensor. This change of the problem settings complicates the solutions compared to that by using a disk coverage model. We first define the target information coverage (TIC) problem and prove its NP-completeness. We then propose a heuristic to approximately solve our problem. Simulation results show that our heuristic is better than an existing algorithm and is close to the upper bound when only the sensing disk coverage model is used. Furthermore, simulation results also show that the network lifetime can be significantly improved by using the notion of information coverage compared with that by using the conventional definition of sensing disk coverage.

HSCR: Hierarchical structured cluster routing protocol for load balanced wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spe.3095,5,SPECIAL ISSUE PAPER,Wiley,"clustering,hierarchical structure,multi-hop communication,routing","The robustness of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has made it a preferred choice for many applications. WSNs should perform the intended sensing task with a limited amount of energy. Clustering methodology is used to reduce sensor nodes' energy consumption and increase the network lifetime by organizing nodes into independent groups. In this article, a hierarchical structured cluster routing (HSCR) protocol based on the principle of an m-way balanced tree has been proposed for multi-hop intra-cluster communication and offload the cluster head. It enhances the network performance by providing an underlying architecture that reduces the intra-cluster communication distance and the amount of data sent to the cluster head. In the proposed HSCR protocol, an m-way tree-based hierarchical structure has been proposed in which balanced structure is formed within each cluster so that data aggregation is performed at each intermediate parent node. The proposed approach can be implemented over any communication protocol used in WSNs. Simulation results prove that the proposed algorithms outperform traditional clustering algorithms, LEACH and CT-RPL, in terms of network stability, energy consumption, and network lifetime.

When applying the negative selection algorithm to wireless sensor networks, the characteristics of wireless sensor networks, such as frequent changes in network topology and limited resources, are not considered too much, which makes the detection effect to need improvement. In this paper, a negative selection algorithm based on spatial partition is proposed and applied to hierarchical wireless sensor networks. The algorithm first analyzes the distribution of self-set in the real-valued space then divides the real-valued space, and several subspaces are obtained. Selves are filled into different subspaces. We implement the negative selection algorithm in the subspace. The randomly generated candidate detector only needs to be tolerated with selves in the subspace where the detector is located, not all the selves. This operation reduces the time cost of distance calculation. In the detection process of detectors, the antigen which is to be detected only needs to match the mature detectors in the subspace where the antigen is located, rather than all the detectors. This operation speeds up the antigen detection process.

The approach presented in this paper extends the existing PBR (priority-based routing) protocol by providing a new fault-tolerant multipath priority-based routing (FT-MPPBR) scheme, which not only balances the energy consumption while selecting multiple paths but also balances the workload of the node closest to the sink. The nodes closer to the sink dissipate more energy and can become the source of a communication bottleneck. Simulation results for the proposed routing scheme are encouraging and clearly show that the FT-MPPBR has outperformed the existing PBR schemes in terms of prolonging the network lifetime and reliability.

HIKES uses a partial key escrow scheme that enables any sensor node selected as a cluster head to generate all the cryptographic keys needed to authenticate other sensors within its cluster. This scheme localizes secret key issuance and reduces the communication cost with the base station. HIKES provides an efficient broadcast authentication in which source authentication is achieved in a single transmission and a good defense for the routing mechanism. HIKES defends the routing mechanism against most known attacks and is robust against node compromise.

Clustering is achieved using nature-inspired grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, and CH selection is accomplished using fuzzy inference-based system.

Enhanced Key Management Protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/627548,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"With rapid development and extensive use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is urgent to enhance the security for WSNs, in which key management is an effective way to protect WSNs from various attacks. However, different types of messages exchanged in WSNs typically have different security requirements which cannot be satisfied by a single keying mechanism. In this study, a basic key management protocol is described for WSNs based on four kinds of keys, which can be derived from an initial master key, and an enhanced protocol is proposed based on Diffie-Hellman algorithm. The proposed scheme restricts the adverse security impact of a captured node to the rest of WSNs and meets the requirement of energy efficiency by supporting in-network processing. The master key protection, key revocation mechanism, and the authentication mechanism based on one-way hash function are, respectively, discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed from the aspects of computational efficiency, storage requirement and communication cost, and its antiattack capability in protecting WSNs is discussed under various attack models.

Cooperative and feedback based authentic routing protocol for energy efficient IoT systems,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.6886,4,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"Internet of Things,network lifetime,next-trustable route,routing,security attacks,trust value","The open communication medium of the Internet of Things (IoT) is more vulnerable to security attacks. As the IoT environment consists of distributed power limited units, the routing protocol used for distributed routing should be light-weighted compared to other centralized networks. In this situation, complex security algorithms and routing mechanisms affect the generic data communications in IoT platforms. To handle this problem, this proposed system develops a cooperative and feedback-based trustable energy-efficient routing protocol (CFTEERP). This protocol calculates local trust value (LTV) and global trust value (GTV) of each node using node attributes and K-means-based feedback evaluation procedures. The K-means clustering algorithm leaves out the distorted node routing metrics and misbehaving node metrics for all channels. This proposed CFTEERP uses the nearest secure node costs to increase the network lifetime without selecting the nearest nodes for routing the data. In this work, secure routing is initiated using multipath routing strategy that analyses LTV, GTV, next trustable node, average throughput, energy consumption, average packet delivery ratio (PDR) and traffic various metrics of entire IoT communication. The technical aspects of proposed system are implemented to solve different existing techniques' limitations. In the comparative experiment, the proposed method provides 90% of PDR and a minimal energy consumption rate of 25% lesser than the existing systems against different malicious attacks.",10 February 2022,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,"A.

A comparatively new algorithm motivated by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves is Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which is a very successful algorithm for solving real mechanical and optical engineering problems.

To overcome this shortcoming, a modified GWO (mGWO) is proposed, which focuses on proper balance between exploration and exploitation that leads to an optimal performance of the algorithm.

However, these networks are highly susceptible to a range of threats, including natural disasters and intentional cyberattacks, which can severely disrupt their functionality. To address these vulnerabilities, we present the resilient smart city (ResiSC) system, designed to enhance the resilience of smart city communication networks through a topological design approach. Our system employs a graph-theoretic algorithm to determine the optimal network topology for a given set of nodes, aiming to maximize connectivity while minimizing link provisioning costs. We introduce two novel connectivity measurements, All Nodes Reachability (ANR) and Sum of All Nodes Reachability (SANR), to evaluate network resilience. We applied our approach to data from two public universities of different sizes, simulating various attack scenarios to assess the robustness of the resulting network topologies. Evaluation results indicate that our solution improves network resilience against targeted attacks by 38% compared to baseline methods such as k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) graphs, while also reducing the number of additional links and their associated costs. Results also indicate that our proposed solution outperforms baseline methods like k-NN in terms of network resilience against targeted attacks by 41%.

However, due to the limitation of wireless sensor network resources, the time and space correlation of data acquisition is strong. In order to reduce the number of nodes participating in data compression, the robust and secure data fusion algorithm based on intelligent sensing is proposed. The algorithm can divide the whole network into many clusters. In order to maintain energy balance of nodes in the cluster, the probability of each node in each cluster participating in each round of data collection is computed according to the residual energy of the node. On the sink node, the number of sampling rounds of joint reconstruction of collected data is designated according to the application requirements and reconstruction accuracy requirements, and the number of nodes participating in is further reduced. The simulation results show that the number of nodes participating in the data collection of the proposed scheme in this paper is lower than that of the ordinary intelligent sensing LEACH data acquisition scheme.

Blockchain-Based Secure Localization against Malicious Nodes in IoT-Based Wireless Sensor Networks Using Federated Learning,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8068038,15,Research Article,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor networks are the core of the Internet of Things and are used in healthcare, locations, the military, and security. Threats to the security of wireless sensor networks built on the Internet of Things (IoT-WSNs) can come from a variety of sources. This study proposes secure attack localization and detection in IoT-WSNs to improve security and service delivery. The technique used blockchain-based cascade encryption and trust evaluation in a hierarchical design to generate blockchain trust values before beacon nodes broadcast data to the base station. Simulation results reveal that cascading encryption and feature assessment measure the trust value of nodes by rewarding each other for service provisioning and trust by removing malicious nodes that reduce localization accuracy and quality of service in the network. Federated machine learning improves data security and transmission by merging raw device data and placing malicious threats in the blockchain. Malicious nodes are classified through federated learning. Federated learning combines hybrid random forest, gradient boost, ensemble learning, K-means clustering, and support vector machine approaches to classify harmful nodes via a feature assessment process. Comparing the proposed system to current ones shows an average detection and classification accuracy of 100% for binary and 99.95% for multiclass.

Thus, a novel niche quantum ant colony-based WAMRN clustering optimization method is proposed in this paper to address the problem of how to make full use of the limited energy to extend network lifetime and improve data transmission efficiency. In the proposed approach, a clustering model of WAMRN is defined; moreover, an improved Niche Quantum Ant Colony Optimization (NQACO) is proposed to optimize the model therefore to obtain an optimal clustering scheme, which can help WAMRN reduce unnecessary energy loss to achieve the purpose of extending the lifetime of the entire network. To verify the performance of the proposed method, NQACO is compared with some popular clustering methods, i.e., GA and SA, under different scenarios.

A decline in yield of such systems has been observed and ascribed to quantitative and qualitative variations of soil organic matter (SOM). We evaluated the impact of the annual rotation: rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), jute (Corchorus olitorius L.), with and without fertilizer treatments (control, N, N–P, N–P–K, and N–P–K plus farmyard manure [FYM]) on SOM and aggregate properties. At 0- to 15-cm soil depth, microbial biomass C and N, hot water–soluble C and N and hydrolyzable carbohydrates, and particulate organic matter C (POMC) and N (POMN) were found in the order N–P–K plus FYM > N–P–K > N–P > N > control. Over the course of the experiment, application of N alone decreased total organic C (TOC) by 20.4%, whereas N–P–K with or without FYM addition either maintained or enhanced compared to initial. Total soil N and mineralizable N declined in all the treatments except N–P–K plus FYM. Irrespective of treatments, microaggregates (53–250 μm) dominated with 43.9 to 51.3% of total soil aggregate size distribution, followed by macroaggregates (250–2000 μm with 34.6 to 40.1%). The C and N mineralization rate was greater in macroaggregates than in microaggregates, and correlated significantly with POMC (r = 0.67, P ≤ 0.01) and POMN (r = 0.88, P ≤ 0.01). Nitrogen–phosphorus–potassium plus FYM also improved overall soil aggregation as compared to other treatments. Therefore, the results suggest that the gradual depletion of nutrients and structural degradation may have collectively contributed to the crop yield declines in the rice–wheat–jute rotation and that the integrated use of N–P–K and FYM is an important nutrient management option for sustaining this cropping system.",01 January 2006,Soil Science Society of America Journal,"M.

However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is ≈1%. Higher PCE of 3.15% and transparency of 51.4% are obtained from the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of a wide energy gap conjugated polymer and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA).

Firstly, one of the leading drawbacks of wireless networks is their energy consumption because the constituent nodes of the network have a restricted battery capacity yet greater consumption caused by the mobility of the nodes, their processing power, the frequent sending of data, and so on. Secondly, data packets may be lost due to traffic, noise, or the mobility of nodes, whose data transmission in real-time applications would be compromised by this loss. In order to resolve the problem of energy consumption and that of the loss of data packets for MANETs, we propose a new stable-aware differential evolution-based routing protocol (SDERP).

Moreover, efficient delivery ratio, secure data forwarding are not achieved because of the enormous amount of data produced by these smart devices and the possibility of security threats.

Sensing and communicating the low priority events happen in major portion of the lifetime for the sensor nodes. However, if the event occurs, then it should be detected and communicated at the earliest to the base station or to the sink node. To reduce the network traffic due to low priority data, we propose a cross layered algorithm to improve the lifetime of the sensor nodes in the case of clustered architecture. In spite of the increase in the network lifetime, the time to detect and communicate to the base station is maintained as that of the traditional clustering approach. The proposed algorithm is simulated, and results show significant improvement in the lifetime of the sensor nodes with guaranteed latency. In this paper, we also suggest methods to support the latency to sensor nodes on priority basis for continuous reporting.",29 May 2019,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Sundaravanan Jothiprakasam,Chandrasekaran Muthial,","(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering Thanthai Periyar Government Institute of Technology Vellore Tamil Nadu India),(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering Government College of Engineering Bargur Tamil Nadu India),","India,India,India"
An Intelligent Smart Parking System Using Convolutional Neural Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/7571716,4,Research Article,Wiley,,"Saudi Arabia has started building smart cities and communities as part of the Saudi 2030 vision, which aims to digitalize all services. Smart cities use different types of technologies and data to improve the quality of life for citizens, manage resources, and make operations more efficient. In big cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, the number of vehicles on the road has dramatically increased. Hence, parking has become a problem since there are limited spaces available. In this article, a novel, intelligent, and automated method for vehicle parking and management is proposed. This approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) tool to train the algorithm deeply. Image segmentation and preprocessing techniques are employed as well. All operations are automated and cost-effective since the proposed smart parking management system utilizes only a single camera to provide real-time views of the status of a parking lot. Furthermore, there is no need for human interference, and it is easy to maintain. Several simulation scenarios were conducted on MATLAB to validate this approach and prove its efficiency.

Energy-Efficient Broadcasting Scheme for Smart Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/7538190,36,Research Article,Wiley,,"In smart Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs), sensor nodes usually adopt a programmable technology. These smart devices can obtain new or special functions by reprogramming: they upgrade their soft systems through receiving new version of program codes. If sensor nodes need to be upgraded, the sink node will propagate program code packets to them through “one-to-many” broadcasting, and therefore new capabilities can be obtained, forming the so-called Software Defined Network (SDN). However, due to the high volume of code packet, the constraint energy of sensor node, and the unreliable link quality of wireless network, rapidly broadcasting the code packets to all nodes in network can be a challenge issue. In this paper, a novel Energy-efficient Broadcast scheme with adjustable broadcasting radius is proposed aiming to improve the performance of network upgrade. In our scheme, the nonhotspots sensor nodes take full advantage of their residual energy caused in data collection period to improve the packet reception probability and reduce the broadcasting delay of code packet transmission by enlarging the broadcasting radius, that is, the transmitting power.

Under the optimum reaction conditions, the recovery of vanadium and chromium can reach 93.7% and 88.2% in 6 h, respectively. The kinetics investigation indicates that the decomposition of vanadium slag is controlled by mass transfer in product layer. During the reaction, NaOH is believed to provide basic media and facilitate the dissolution of acidic oxides. NaNO3 decomposes to produce a large amount of active oxygen species, such as O, , and O2−. NaOH intensifies the decomposition of NaNO3 to NaNO2, but inhibits further decomposition of NaNO2.

These applications vary from health care, smart cities, and military applications to environmental monitoring and disaster prevention. As a result, energy consumption and network lifetime have become the most critical research area of WSNs. Through energy-efficient routing protocols, it is possible to reduce energy consumption and extend the network lifetime for WSNs. Using hybrid routing protocols that incorporate multiple transmission methods is an effective way to improve network performance. This paper proposes modulated R-SEP (MR-SEP) for large-scale WSN-based IoT applications. MR-SEP is based on the well-known stable election protocol (SEP). MR-SEP defines three initial energy levels for the nodes to improve the network energy distribution and establishes multi-hop communication between the cluster heads (CHs) and the base station (BS) through relay nodes (RNs) to reduce the energy consumption of the nodes to reach the BS. In addition, MR-SEP reduces the replacement frequency of CHs, which helps increase network lifetime and decrease power consumption.

Trust Mechanisms to Secure Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks: Current State of the Research and Open Research Issues,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/4724852,41,Review Article,Wiley,,"Routing is one of the most important operations in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as it deals with data delivery to base stations. Routing attacks can cripple it easily and degrade the operation of WSNs significantly. Traditional security mechanisms such as cryptography and authentication alone cannot cope with some of the routing attacks as they come from compromised nodes mostly. Recently, trust mechanism is introduced to enhance security and improve cooperation among nodes. In routing, trust mechanism avoids/includes nodes in routing operation based on the estimated trust value. Many trust-based routing protocols are proposed to secure routing, in which they consider different routing attacks. In this research work, our goal is to explore the current research state and identify open research issues by surveying proposed schemes. To achieve our goal we extensively analyze and discuss proposed schemes based on the proposed framework. Moreover, we evaluate proposed schemes based on two important factors, which are energy consumption and attack resiliency.

However, the issues in such distributed mechanisms are (i) how to assign the time division multiple access (TDMA) schedule to collect the data from the cluster member (CM), (ii) how to distribute and balance the overall energy consumption of the cluster heads (CHs) under the circumstance of node's mobility. To overcome these problems, a cluster switched data gathering protocol (CSDGP) is proposed which ensures a uniform distribution of CHs by utilising a waiting time-based CH selection and an effective cluster switch based TDMA scheduling mechanism. The salient feature observed in the proposed CSDGP is that the migrated node has a chance to transmit the sensed data to the CH, whenever the CH has a free time slot.

Efficient Routing Approach Using a Collaborative Strategy,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/2547061,9,Research Article,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a huge number of sensors, which are distributed in area monitoring to collect important signals. WSNs are widely used in several applications such as home automation, environment, and healthcare monitoring. However, most of these applications face various difficulties due to sensor design. Therefore, the major challenge of designing WSNs is saving the energy consumed during communication and extending the network lifetime. Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods have been exploited for saving network energy. However, the majority of researches focus on the Cluster Head (CH) selection. In this paper, we aim to enhance the process of forwarder selection using an efficient combined multicriteria model. The proposed scheme improved the intercluster communication by controlling the distance separating CHs from the sink node. To minimize the cluster density, this work consists of activating only sensor nodes that detect enough strong signals. The activation phase presents a fault-tolerant technique to succeed in the communication process. Moreover, the proposed work is aimed at selecting the most efficient hops, which are responsible for routing data to the sink using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods.

This is because of the imbalance of the consumption of energy by the nodes in wireless sensor networks. This decreases the network's lifetime. Unequal clustering is a technique to cope up with this issue. In this paper, an algorithm, “fuzzy-based unequal clustering algorithm,” is proposed to prolong the lifetime of the network. This protocol forms unequal clusters. This is to balance the energy consumption. Cluster head selection is done through fuzzy logic approach. Input variables are the distance to base station, residual energy, and density. Competition radius and rank are the two output fuzzy variables. Mamdani method is employed for fuzzy inference. The protocol is compared with well-known algorithms, like low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, energy-aware unequal clustering fuzzy, multi-objective fuzzy clustering algorithm, and fuzzy-based unequal clustering under different network scenarios. In all the scenarios, the proposed protocol performs better.

A Data Collection Strategy for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Energy Efficiency and Collaborative Optimization,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/9808449,13,Research Article,Wiley,,"In the clustering routing protocol, prolonging the lifetime of the sensor network depends to a large extent on the rationality of the cluster head node selection. The selection of cluster heads for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs) does not consider the remaining energy of the current nodes and the distribution of nodes, which leads to an imbalance of network energy consumption. A strategy for selecting cluster heads of HWSNs based on the improved sparrow search algorithm- (ISSA-) optimized self-organizing maps (SOM) is proposed. In the stage of cluster head selection, the proposed algorithm establishes a competitive neural network model at the base station and takes the nodes of the competing cluster heads as the input vector. Each input vector includes three elements: the remaining energy of the node, the distance from the node to the base station, and the number of neighbor nodes of the node. The best cluster head is selected through the adaptive learning of the improved competitive neural network. When selecting the cluster head node, comprehensively consider the remaining energy, the distance, and the number of times the node becomes a cluster head and optimize the cluster head node selection strategy to extend the network life cycle. Simulation experiments show that the new algorithm can reduce the energy consumption of the network more effectively than the basic competitive neural network and other algorithms, balance the energy consumption of the network, and further prolong the lifetime of the sensor network.",29 September 2021,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"Li Cao,Yinggao Yue,Yong Zhang,","(School of Intelligent Manufacturing and Electronic Engineering, Wenzhou University of Technology, Wenzhou 325035, China),(School of Intelligent Manufacturing and Electronic Engineering, Wenzhou University of Technology, Wenzhou 325035, China),(Computer School, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang 441053, China hbuas.edu.cn),","China,China,China"

HCA of MHMLC also produces optimal intermediate CHs for intercluster multihop communications that develop heterogeneity-aware economical links. This hybrid cluster-formation facilitates the sensors to function at short range transmission power level that enhances link quality and avoids packet drop.

EEHRT: Energy Efficient Technique for Handling Redundant Traffic in Zone-Based Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/7502140,10,Research Article,Wiley,,"This paper presents an energy-efficient technique to handle redundant traffic (EEHRT) in the zone-based routing for wireless sensor networks. In this technique, multihop routing is performed based on the remaining energy of the nodes. Afterwards, it performs position-based routing without the need for the nodes to know their respective position. The main objective of this paper is to handle the redundant packets generated in zone-based routing using short beacon messages. Nodes of lower zones route the data of the higher zone to base station (BS) with a minimum number of hops and utilize only those nodes on the path which are energy efficient and located closer to BS. Moreover, the source node is acknowledged by the relaying node using a wireless broadcast advantage (WBA) without sending any special ACK packet to the sender, which reduces the control overhead in the routing process. The EEHRT technique improves the routing against RARZ by ensuring only one copy of the packet is propagated at each hop along the routing path to BS. Simulation results show that EEHRT achieved 28% improvement in energy efficiency, 10% and 25% improvements in data throughput against total and distinct packet reception at BS respectively, 35% increase in overall network lifetime, and 100% reduction in redundant packets generation and propagation in the network against RARZ routing.",06 May 2019,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Rab Nawaz Jadoon,WuYang Zhou,Iftikhar Ahmed Khan,Muhammad Amir Khan,Waqas Jadoon,","(School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230000, China ustc.edu.cn),(Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University, Islamabad-Abbottabad Campus 22060, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),(School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230000, China ustc.edu.cn),(Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University, Islamabad-Abbottabad Campus 22060, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),(Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS University, Islamabad-Abbottabad Campus 22060, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),","China,China,Pakistan,Pakistan,Pakistan"

We have proposed secure CH selection algorithm by calculating weight of each node to deal with secure selection using minimum energy consumption. The weight of node is a combination of different metrics including trust metric (behaviors of sensor node) which promotes a secure decision of a CH selection; in terms of this, the node will never be a malicious one. The trust metric is definitive and permits the proposed clustering algorithm to keep away from any malignant node in the area to select a CH, even if the rest of the parameters are in its favor. Other metrics of node include waiting time, connectivity degree, and distance among nodes. The selection of CHs is completed utilizing weights of member nodes.

Then, the internal environment conditions of developing e-commerce are comprehensively analyzed through human resources, financial resources, marketing ability, and platform building ability, and the advantages and disadvantages of the enterprise itself are presented in a three-dimensional manner to help the enterprise understand its situation. Firstly, the overall hardware structure design of this paper is analyzed, and the network marketing node hardware design is proposed as the core of the system hardware design, and the marketing node hardware design circuit diagram is given through the selection of marketing node sensors, the selection of wireless communication modules, and the selection of marketing node microprocessors. Based on the specific application of the wireless sensor network in the e-commerce marketing system, the number of cluster selection is reduced by calculating and setting the remaining energy threshold of the cluster head for the whole network. The optimal cluster head is searched for based on the density of marketing nodes in different regions and the minimum energy consumption of the cluster after the division of the region within the cluster, and the original cluster head is replaced; the density of marketing nodes in different e-commerce is different, and the optimal number of cluster heads is searched for based on the minimum energy consumption of the network. In summary, three strategies are implemented to improve the design of wireless sensor network routing, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through experimental simulation. Through the analysis of e-commerce operation, the intracluster congestion control is achieved by a dual-cluster head strategy with intracluster push selection of subcluster heads; the network nonuniform hierarchy and resource scheduling strategy achieve intercluster congestion mitigation and decongestion. A minimum energy consumption multihop path tree is also proposed here, which can achieve the lowest energy consumption of marketing nodes and networks and improve the link quality relative to other transmission paths.

Effects of Mowing Height of Cut and Nitrogen on FAO-56 PM Crop Coefficients for Recreational Turf in the Cool-Humid Region,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2135/cropsci2016.05.0363,4,Research,Wiley,,"Irrigating recreational turf requires ET (evapotranspiration) replacement for water conservation and to sustain optimal leaf growth and turf function under traffic stress. Lysimeter measured actual ET (ETa) can be estimated using a reference crop ET (ETo) from meteorological data adjusted using a crop coefficient (Kc, ETa/ETo) to correct for cultural affects on ETa. Previous studies have not fully investigated the effects of turf culture on Kc. The objective of this research was to develop reliable Kc when ETo is computed using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation, with Kc adjusted according to the effects on ETa of two mowing heights of cut (HOC), two N rates, and three species. Creeping bentgrass (CB) as golf turf and Kentucky bluegrass (KB) and perennial ryegrass (PR) as sports-lawn turf were planted in South Deerfield, MA. Species and two N rates (98 and 196 kg N ha–1 yr–1) were arranged as main plots (3.12 by 1.56 m). Main plots were split according to HOC, with KB and PR mowed at 3.125 and 6.25 cm and CB mowed at 0.3125 and 0.9375 cm.

Distributed fuzzy approach to unequal clustering and routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3709,46,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"clustering,hot spot,network lifetime,routing,wireless sensor networks","Due to inherent issue of energy limitation in sensor nodes, the energy conservation is the primary concern for large-scale wireless sensor networks. Cluster-based routing has been found to be an effective mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes. In clustered wireless sensor networks, the network is divided into a set of clusters; each cluster has a coordinator, called cluster head (CH). Each node of a cluster transmits its collected information to its CH that in turn aggregates the received information and sends it to the base station directly or via other CHs. In multihop communication, the CHs closer to the base station are burdened with high relay load; as a result, their energy depletes much faster as compared with other CHs. This problem is termed as the hot spot problem. In this paper, a distributed fuzzy logic-based unequal clustering approach and routing algorithm (DFCR) is proposed to solve this problem. Based on the cluster design, a multihop routing algorithm is also proposed, which is both energy efficient and energy balancing. The simulation results reinforce the efficiency of the proposed DFCR algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms, ie, energy-aware fuzzy approach to unequal clustering, energy-aware distributed clustering, and energy-aware routing algorithm, in terms of different performance parameters like energy efficiency and network lifetime.",28 May 2018,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Nabajyoti Mazumdar,Hari Om,","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad India),(Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad India),","India,India,India"
A Novel Energy-Aware Routing in Wireless Sensor Network Using Clustering Based on Combination of Multiobjective Genetic and Cuckoo Search Algorithm,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/6939868,5,Research Article,Wiley,,"The development of various applications of wireless sensor networks has aroused great interest in using these types of networks in various fields. These networks, without infrastructure and self-organization, are easily deployed in most environments and collect information about environmental phenomena for analysis and proper response to accidents and send them to the basic centers. They do. Wireless sensor networks are made up of some sensor nodes that both act as sensors and act as relay nodes concerning to each other. On the other hand, the lack of infrastructure in these networks has limited resources so that the nodes of the battery are fed with limited energy. Due to the location of networks in difficult and impassable areas, it is not possible to recharge or replace the node battery. Therefore, saving energy consumption in this type of network is one of the most important challenges. Since the rate of energy consumption when sensing information and receiving data packets from another node is a fixed value, so sensor nodes have the highest energy consumption when sending data. Therefore, routing methods try to reduce energy consumption based on systematic approaches. One of the most promising solutions to reduce energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is to cluster the nodes and select the threaded node based on the data transfer parameters so that the average energy consumption in the nodes is reduced and the network lifetime is increased. Therefore, in this research, a new optimization approach using multiobjective genetic algorithm and cuckoo algorithm for clustering wireless sensor networks is presented. In this study, in order to select clustered nodes from a multiobjective genetic algorithms based on reducing intracluster distances and reducing energy consumption in cluster member nodes and near-optimal routing based on cuckoo optimization algorithm to transfer information between nodes have been used in the direction of the cavity. The implementation results show that considering the evolutionary capabilities of the multiobjective genetic algorithm and the cuckoo optimization algorithm, the proposed method in terms of energy consumption, efficiency, delivery rate, and packet transmission latency, compared to previous methods, has improved.",19 April 2022,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Xiuniao Zhao,Wentao Zhong,Yahya Dorostkar Navaei,","(College of Electronic Information Engineering, Gannan University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou, 341000 Jiangxi, China),(School of Information Engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou, 341000 Jiangxi, China jxust.edu.cn),(Department of Computer and Technology Engineering, Qazvin Branch, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran azad.ac.ir),","China,China"

In this paper, a clone adaptive whale optimization algorithm (CAWOA) is designed for reducing the routing energy consumption of IWSNs with QoS constraints, and a novel clone operator is proposed. More importantly, CAWOA innovatively adopts a discrete binary-based routing coding method, which provides strong support for optimal routing schemes. In addition, a novel routing model of IWSNs combined with QoS constraints has been designed, which involves comprehensive consideration of bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, and packet loss rate. Subsequently, in a series of simulations, the proposed algorithm is compared with other heuristic-based routing algorithms, namely, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results suggest that the CAWOA-based routing algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of routing energy consumption, convergence speed, and optimization ability.

In view of this, we propose low-overhead and dynamic Coding-Aware Routing via Tree-based Address (CARTA) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In CARTA, a Multi-Root Multi-Tree Topology (MRMTT) with a tree-based address allocation mechanism is firstly constructed to provide transmission paths for data flows. Then, a low-overhead coding condition judgment method is provided to detect real-time coding opportunities via tree address calculation in the MRMTT. Further, CARTA defines routing address adjustments caused by encoding and decoding to ensure the flows’ routing paths can be adjusted flexibly according to their real-time coding opportunities. It also makes additional constraints on congestion and hop count in the coding condition judgment to relieve network congestion and control the hop counts of routing paths.

Energy-Efficient Relay-Based Void Hole Prevention and Repair in Clustered Multi-AUV Underwater Wireless Sensor Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/9969605,20,Research Article,Wiley,,"Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) enable various oceanic applications which require effective packet transmission. In this case, sparse node distribution, imbalance in terms of overall energy consumption between the different sensor nodes, dynamic network topology, and inappropriate selection of relay nodes cause void holes. Addressing this problem, we present a relay-based void hole prevention and repair (ReVOHPR) protocol by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for UWSN. ReVOHPR is a global solution that implements different phases of operations that act mutually in order to efficiently reduce and identify void holes and trap relay nodes to avoid it. ReVOHPR adopts the following operations as ocean depth (levels)-based equal cluster formation, dynamic sleep scheduling, virtual graph-based routing, and relay-assisted void hole repair. For energy-efficient cluster forming, entropy-based eligibility ranking (E2R) is presented, which elects stable cluster heads (CHs). Then, dynamic sleep scheduling is implemented by the dynamic kernel Kalman filter (DK2F) algorithm in which sleep and active modes are based on the node’s current status. Intercluster routing is performed by maximum matching nodes that are selected by dual criteria, and also the data are transmitted to AUV. Finally, void holes are detected and repaired by the bicriteria mayfly optimization (BiCMO) algorithm. The BiCMO focuses on reducing the number of holes and data packet loss and maximizes the quality of service (QoS) and energy efficiency of the network. This protocol is timely dealing with node failures in packet transmission via multihop routing. Simulation is implemented by the NS3 (AquaSim module) simulator that evaluates the performance in the network according to the following metrics: average energy consumption, delay, packet delivery rate, and throughput. The simulation results of the proposed REVOHPR protocol comparing to the previous protocols allowed to conclude that the REVOHPR has considerable advantages.

When a sensor node becomes overloaded, the likelihood of higher latency, energy loss, and congestion becomes high. In this paper, we propose an optimal load balanced clustering for hierarchical cluster-based wireless sensor networks. We formulate the network design problem as mixed-integer linear programming. Our contribution is 3-fold: First, we propose an energy aware cluster head selection model for optimal cluster head selection. Then we propose a delay and energy-aware routing model for optimal inter-cluster communication. Finally, we propose an equal traffic for energy efficient clustering for optimal load balanced clustering. We consider the worst case scenario, where all nodes have the same capability and where there are no ways to use mobile sinks or add some powerful nodes as gateways. Thus, our models perform load balancing and maximize network lifetime with no need for special node capabilities such as mobility or heterogeneity or pre-deployment, which would greatly simplify the problem.

On the implant communication and MAC protocols for WBAN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.1100,28,Research Article,Wiley,"in-body,on-body,RF communication,implant,WBAN","Recent advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems, wireless communication, low-power intelligent sensors, and semiconductor technologies have allowed the realization of a wireless body area network (WBAN). A WBAN provides unobtrusive health monitoring for a long period of time with real-time updates to the physician. It is widely used for ubiquitous health care, entertainment, and military applications. The implantable and wearable medical devices have several critical requirements such as power consumption, data rate, size, and low-power medium access control (MAC) protocols. This article consists of two parts: body implant communication, which is concerned with the communication to and from a human body using radio frequency (RF) technology, and WBAN MAC protocols, which presents several low-power MAC protocols for a WBAN with useful guidelines including a case study of IEEE 802.15.4, PB-TDMA, and SMAC protocols. In body implant communication, the in-body RF performance is affected considerably by the implant's depth and different polarization combinations inside the human body as well as by the muscle and fat. We observe best performance at a depth of 3 to 5 cm and not close to the human skin. Furthermore, the study of low-power MAC protocols highlights the most important aspects of developing a novel low-power and reliable MAC protocol for a WBAN.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in improving network lifetime. Node energy plays an important role in the network lifetime. Along with this remarkable growth in wireless sensor networks, however, there is an increasing concern over network lifetime. The principal purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the effects of other parameters on selecting a cluster head. The methodological approach taken in this study is a mixed methodology typically based on the node's energy. The authors have operated four parameters to select the cluster head: Node energy, the energy of the node's neighbours, number of hops and number of links to neighbours. Each of these parameters has an impact in selecting the cluster head.

SF-LAP: Secure M2M Communication in IIoT with a Single-Factor Lightweight Authentication Protocol,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/1309402,4,Research Article,Wiley,,"Machine-to-machine communication allows smart devices like sensors, actuators, networks, gateways, and other controllers to communicate with one another. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has become a vital component. Many industrial devices are connected to perform a task automatically in machine-to-machine communication, but they are not properly secured, allowing an adversary to compromise them against a variety of attacks due to communication system vulnerabilities. Recently, a secure lightweight authentication protocol (SLAP) was proposed by Panda et al. They asserted that every known attack that could happen in the IIoT is deterred by their suggested protocol. In this study, we prove that the SLAP protocol is vulnerable to desynchronization, impersonation, replay, and eavesdropping attacks. To prevent these attacks and enhance that protocol, we need to implement a secure authentication mechanism that ensures the security of communication. This paper proposed a secure M2M Communication in IIoT with a single-factor lightweight authentication protocol (SF-LAP). Single-factor authentication is a simple and secure way to communicate. It uses less power and communication overhead while providing a secure mechanism for conversation. In the machine-to-machine (M2M) scenario, the proposed protocol uses an exclusive-OR operation and a hashing function to ensure secure communication between the sensor and the controller. The proposed mechanism uses a secure preshared key and timestamp technique to protect and safeguard this connection against desynchronization attacks and eavesdropping attacks. We used Burrows Abadi Needham (BAN) Gong, Needham, and Yahalom (GNY) logic, and the automated validation of Internet security protocols applications (AVISPA) tool for formal verification and perform a security analysis as an informal verification to make sure the suggested protocol is secure. Analysis that shows the SF-LAP consumes the least computing and communication overhead and is more secure because it prevents desynchronization and eavesdropping attacks to all of the known attacks that are modification attacks, tracing attacks, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks.",10 November 2022,Journal of Sensors,"Khurram Shahzad,Masoom Alam,Nadeem Javaid,Abdul Waheed,Shehzad Ashraf Chaudhry,Nafees Mansoor,Mahdi Zareei,","(Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),(Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),(Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, 44000, Pakistan comsats.edu.pk),(Department of Computer Science, Women University Swabi, Swabi 23430, Pakistan wus.edu.pk),(School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea snu.ac.kr),(Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, College of Engineering, Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, UAE adu.ac.ae),(Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Nisantasi University, Istanbul 34398, Turkey nisantasi.edu.tr),","Pakistan,Pakistan,Pakistan,Pakistan"
Recent Changes in the ISBA-CTRIP Land Surface System for Use in the CNRM-CM6 Climate Model and in Global Off-Line Hydrological Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018MS001545,122,Research Article,Wiley,"land surface processes,hydrology,snow,permafrost","In recent years, significant efforts have been made to upgrade physical processes in the ISBA-CTRIP land surface system for use in fully coupled climate studies using the new CNRM-CM6 climate model or in stand-alone mode for global hydrological applications. Here we provide a thorough description of the new and improved processes implemented between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 versions of the model and evaluate the hydrology and thermal behavior of the model at the global scale. The soil scheme explicitly solves the one-dimensional Fourier and Darcy laws throughout the soil, accounting for the dependency of hydraulic and thermal soil properties on soil organic carbon content. The snowpack is represented using a multilayer detailed internal-process snow scheme. A two-way dynamic flood scheme is added in which floodplains interact with the soil hydrology through reinfiltration of floodwater and with the overlying atmosphere through surface free-water evaporation. Finally, groundwater processes are represented via a two-dimensional diffusive unconfined aquifer scheme allowing upward capillarity rises into the superficial soil. This new system has been evaluated in off-line mode using two different atmospheric forcings and against a large set of satellite estimates and in situ observations. While this study is not without weaknesses, its results show a real advance in modeling the physical aspects of the land surface with the new ISBA-CTRIP version compared to the previous system.

An Indoor Positioning and Prewarning System Based on Wireless Sensor Network Routing Algorithm,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/7213595,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"One of the most important means to position abnormal devices is to efficiently utilize the resources of wireless sensor network (WSN) and make proper analysis of the relevant data. Therefore, this paper constructs an indoor positioning and prewarning system that utilizes energy efficiently and achieves a long lifecycle. Firstly, the adjacent round iteration load balancing (ARILB) routing algorithm was proposed, which elects the cluster heads (CHs) by the adjacent round strategy. In this way, the random components were eliminated in CH election. Next, a short-distance multifrequency routing strategy was constructed between CHs to transmit the information to the sink, and a positioning algorithm was designed called ARILB-received signal strength (RSS). The ARILB-RSS positioning algorithm traverses the triangles formed by anchor nodes, forming multiple sets of ranging points; then, the optimal anchor node is recorded, and the path loss factor is iterated to reduce the positioning error. Simulation shows that the network survives 54.5% longer using ARILB than using the distributed energy-efficient clustering (DEEC) algorithm; the packet delivery rate using ARILB was about 139% higher than that of low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm and 35% higher than that of uneven clustering routing algorithm based on chain-cluster type (URCC) algorithm; ARILB-RSS reduced the ranging error by 14.31% and then the positioning error by 26.79%.",05 November 2021,Journal of Sensors,"Yanghua Gao,Weidong Lou,Hailiang Lu,","(Information Center, China Tobacco Zhejiang Industrial Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310008, China),(Information Center, China Tobacco Zhejiang Industrial Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310008, China),(Information Center, China Tobacco Zhejiang Industrial Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310008, China),","China,China,China"

Today, Internet of Things (IoT) has made it feasible to evaluate healthcare. The IoMT sends the patient's condition to the health center through the Internet rather than keeping them in the hospital all the time for therapy. IoT offers wireless connectivity between virtually anything and smart devices on one side. Data must be transferred to a doctor or other practitioner within the allotted time since this network works with medical and critical circumstances; this shows that routing is the most important problem. Routing is therefore viewed as a very significant difficulty in WBANs. The simulation findings show that, for the WBAN under consideration, the IoT-based stable increased-throughput multi-hop protocol for link efficiency protocol has better throughput, end-to-end delay, and propagation delay compared to adaptive threshold-based thermal-aware energy-efficient multi-hop protocol. Higher packet delivery to the sink is a result of longer stability periods, which is very desirable for ongoing patient monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSN-CDF: New community detection framework to improve routing in mobile social networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4989,1,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"community-based routing,community detection,delay-tolerant networks,mobile social networks","In mobile social networks (MSN), portable devices of mobile users communicate with each other. The contact and intercontact times are the two most important parameters that specify the behavior of MSN. Many social features such as similarity, centrality, closeness, and distance are derived from contact and intercontact time patterns. Those parameters and features can be used in the community detection process in community-based routing as a vector weight of network graph edges. But there is no solution for proper exploitation of them as a multicriteria optimization of community detection algorithms so that the communities become more adaptive with the MSN quiddity and the computational complexity of the algorithms to be stay constant. In this paper, we propose the MSN-adaptive community detection framework, MSN-CDF, which meets these demands. We improve the quality function of community detection methods, for example, the Intensity in clique percolation methods and the Modularity in modularity-based methods, through our new model-based joint optimization of their quality functions. To this end, to express the MSN contact and social features, we develop a criterion called MCSF. It holds the contact time and intercontact time distributions parameters and implies their social features for MSN purposes. This criterion has as little traffic as possible and enjoys from the probabilistic joint distribution model. The simulations show that MSN-CDF reduces the network overhead significantly compared with the DiBUBB, Epidemic, and Dynamic Routing.

Critical application areas of WSN include defence and military surveillance, weather monitoring, health care monitoring, and Internet of Things. Extensive research efforts have been made to improve energy and data delivery performance in WSN with different bio-inspired optimized clustering methodologies such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the bacterial foraging algorithm for optimization (BFAO). However, most constrained solutions are limited to data aggregation performance and enhance the energy efficiency of the network to some extent. Therefore, balancing energy and data delivery performance to a greater extent is crucial because of design limitations imposed on existing hierarchical solutions. This article introduces a novel clustering paradigm, namely optimal clustering using the Artificial Bee Colony (OCABC) algorithm, which improves energy efficiency based on a simplified and robust ABC algorithm. The central idea is to increase the network lifetime of the WSN by optimizing the cluster formation process. The implemented structured module of OCABC attempts to overcome challenges encountered in existing baselines.

An Optimized and Energy-Efficient Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol Based on Dynamic Forwarding Probability (AODVI),https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/5750767,none,Research Article,Wiley,,"MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) is a wireless ad-hoc network made up of mobile devices that use peer-to-peer routing to provide network access instead of using a preexisting network infrastructure. Despite the network infrastructure’s simplicity, it faces issues such as changeable connection capacity, dynamic topology, node battery power exhaustion, and inadequate physical security. Broadcasting is a standard MANET approach for sending messages from a source node to all other nodes in the network. Flooding is a frequent method for broadcasting route request (RREQ) packets, which is susceptible to broadcast storms. The high retransmission rate is caused by the standard flooding technique, which causes media congestion and packet collisions, which can drastically reduce throughput and network performance. In a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient broadcasting focuses on selecting a compact forward node set while assuring broadcast coverage. The goal is to find a limited number of forward nodes that will provide complete coverage. In this paper, we propose an optimized and energy-efficient routing protocol for MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) based on dynamic forwarding probability in general and AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) in particular, in which the route request packets are randomly controlled to increase the network lifetime and reduce packet loss in the flooding algorithm. We tested and assessed the results of our proposed solution using various network performance factors after implementing and integrating it into NS-2. According to simulation findings, our proposed technique effectively reduced route request propagation messages (RREQ). The suggested technique is more efficient, has a longer network lifetime, and uniformly utilizes node residual energy, enhancing network throughput and minimizing routing overhead when compared to regular and modified AODV protocols.",08 November 2022,Journal of Computer Networks and Communications,"Hailu Gizachew Yirga,Gizatie Desalegn Taye,Henock Mulugeta Melaku,","(Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Informatics, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia uog.edu.et),(Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Technology, Debre Tabor University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia dtu.edu.et),(School of Information Technology and Engineering (SiTE), Addis Ababa Institute of Technology-AAiT, Addis Ababa University (AAU), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia aastu.edu.et),","Ethiopia,Ethiopia,Ethiopia"

Due to the starch–polyphenol interaction, the temperature and enthalpy required for starch gelatinisation were decreased by 0.90–1.10 °C and 2.85–3.31 J/g, respectively, when 2.0% tea extract was added compared with the control. Furthermore, the dry noodles showed lower starch pasting viscosities (reduced by 28.35%–55.20%) and increased resistance to breakdown and retrogradation. Through the hydrogen bonding between gliadins and tea polyphenols, the conformation of gluten was modified (15.41%–24.62% and 15.19%–22.95% increases in α-helix and β-sheet contents, respectively) and its structure was strengthened. The combined effect of tea extracts on starch gelatinisation and gluten formation behaviour resulted in the restricted water permeability and mobility in the structure of cooked noodles, which was associated with increased hardness (13.15–16.34 N), cohesiveness (0.63–0.69), chewiness (7.47–10.88) and resilience (0.34–0.42). It also decreased the absolute adhesiveness (0.11–0.13 N.sec) of cooked YANs. In the alkaline noodle system, three kinds of tea extracts exhibited similar effects on the quality characteristics of YAN.

When the aggregating node is utilized to transmit the data to the base station, the research attempts to show that the traffic situations of WSN may be modified appropriately by parameter tuning and algorithm modification. IWD is used to generate an optimum data aggregation tree in WSN as one of its applications. IWD assumes that all nodes in the environment are identical, resulting in identical parameter updates for all nodes. In practical scenarios, however, diverse nodes with variable beginning energy, communication range, and sensing range characteristics are deployed. In order to replicate the influence of heterogeneity in the environment, improved IID (IIWD) is offered as an enhancement to the original IID. The suggested enhancement is appropriate for scenarios in which the aggregation node is utilized to transmit data to the base station in heterogeneous configurations. In terms of residual energy, dead nodes, payload, and network lifespan, a series of simulation results demonstrates that the proposed IIWD significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the IWD method in comparison.",28 September 2022,Journal of Sensors,"S.

Therefore, to maximize network lifetime is the ultimate solution. Dividing the sensing region of wireless sensor network into clusters is an excellent approach to gain high energy efficiency and to enhance lifetime of the network.

Therefore, the authors sought to investigate whether the location of sinks can affect network parameters, such as capacity and delay. In this study, two schemes named popular-location scheme and random scheme are designed based on sink location. In the popular-location scheme, the sinks (base stations) are located around the popular points (most visited locations) according to the location popularity rule. However, in the random scheme, sinks are distributed randomly. The authors considered a cell-partitioned network to manage the signal interference between cells. The authors' results demonstrated that there is a trade-off between capacity and delay in both schemes. Additionally, the effect of packet redundancy on capacity and delay was investigated.

In IoT, the devices distributed globally that are connected to the Internet improve productivity in various sectors. The network plays an important role for transferring data to the sink node by collecting from all other nodes in IoT. The IoT requires energy saving since it is connected to resource-constrained devices. Energy preservation is a difficult challenge to improve network lifetime in IoT. Clustering is one of the key techniques to extend the network’s life. In that, cluster head selection is one of the promising techniques to extend the lifespan of the IoT network. Many researchers proposed various cluster head (CH) selection techniques in IoT. However, inappropriate CH selection quickly degrades a network battery and creates an energy-hole problem in the network. This paper proposes a novel sandpiper optimization algorithm (SOA) to select CH among the networks. Later, the cluster is formed by using the Euclidean distance. The proposed SOA’s accomplishments are compared to fitness value-based improved grey wolf optimization (FIGWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony-SD (ABC-SD), and improved artificial bee colony (IABC).

Thus, PI leverage an efficient solution to handle the scarcity of essential resources such as food, water, land units, and crop yields. Thus, farmers gets better returns in the market due to high production. However, in PI, the exchange of crop readings from sensor units to actuators are processed through open channels, that is, Internet. Thus, it open the doors for malicious intruders to deploy network and sensor-based attacks on PI-sensors, to drain the available resources, and battery power of sensor nodes in the network.

RBM: Region-Based Mobile Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/6628226,10,Research Article,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed for different applications for the reason of small-sized and low-cost sensor nodes. However, several challenges that include a low powered battery of the sensor nodes restrict their functionality. Therefore, saving energy in the routing process to extend network life is a serious concern while deploying applications on WSN. To this end, the key technology is clustering, which helps maximize scalability and network lifecycle. Base station (BS) collects data, aggregates it, and extracts the required information. To obtain the maximum outcome, the lifetime of the network is maximized by the use of different techniques and protocols. Data transmissions consume most of the network energy, and the transmissions over normal ranges require less energy as compared to transmissions over long ranges. Moreover, the nodes closer to the BS deplete their energy faster as compared to distant nodes because of traffic overload. The proposed protocol is aimed at reducing energy consumption and increasing the network lifetime. For this purpose, the network is divided into two regions: region 1 closer to the BS communicating directly, whereas region 2 farther away from the BS having routing nodes to communicate with the BS. Routing nodes do not take part in sensing function but will only move in region 2 collecting data and forwarding it to BS. MATLAB is used as the simulation tool for evaluation, and the results are compared with the existing optimized region-based efficient routing (AORED) and low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchical protocol (LEACH) techniques.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of routinely measured soil properties and SOM characteristics on soil gross N mineralization and soil GHG emissions at the landscape scale. This study was carried out in three Canadian Arctic ecosystems: Sub-Arctic (Churchill, MB), Low-Arctic (Daring Lake, NWT), and High-Arctic (Truelove Lowlands, NU). The landscapes were divided into five landform units: (1) upper slope, (2) back slope, (3) lower slope, (4) hummock, and (5) interhummock, which represented a great diversity of Static and Turbic Cryosolic soils including Brunisolic, Gleysolic, and Organic subgroups. Soil gross N mineralization was measured using the 15N dilution technique, whereas soil GHG emissions (N2O, CH4, and CO2) were measured using a multicomponent Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer. Soil organic matter characteristics were determined by (1) water-extractable organic matter, (2) density fractionation of SOM, and (3) solid-state CPMAS 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results showed that gross N mineralization, N2O, and CO2 emissions were affected by SOM quantity and SOM characteristics. Soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction (LF) of SOM, and O-Alkyl-C to Aromatic-C ratio positively influenced gross N mineralization, N2O and CO2 emissions, whereas the relative proportion of Aromatic-C negatively influenced those N and C cycling processes. Relationships between SOM characteristics and CH4 emissions were not significant throughout all Arctic ecosystems. Furthermore, results showed that lower slope and interhummock areas store relatively more labile C than upper and back slope locations. These results are particularly important because they can be used to produce better models that evaluate SOM stocks and dynamics under several climate scenarios and across Arctic landscapes and ecosystems.",15 December 2012,Global Change Biology,"Maxime C.

A Novel Machine Language-Driven Data Aggregation Approach to Predict Data Redundancy in IoT-Connected Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/7096561,1,Research Article,Wiley,,"Real world data aggregation and delivery in Internet of Things (IoT) technology are essential to predict and retrieve target data in short time so that the end user feels no delay but ensures a high quality of information. In addition to habitat monitoring and disaster management, these networks have a wide range of other uses, including security and military operations. The processing capabilities of sensor nodes are restricted due to the fact that they have a limited battery life and hence a modest size and processing capacity. WSNs are also susceptible to failure as a result of the limited battery power available. In WSNs, data aggregation is practiced as an energy efficient strategy to reduce computing and transmission latency. It is because of sensor node distribution density that shares the same data at a time data redundancy comes to exist. It is possible to reduce redundancy by adopting a suitable machine learning algorithm while executing the data aggregation process. Researchers are still chasing behind algorithms and modeling strategies effectively to ease the process of developing an effective and acceptable data aggregation strategy from existing wireless sensor network (WSN) models. A three stage framework is proposed for an efficient data aggregation mechanism, and the stages are Modified LEACH, extreme learning machines (ELM), adaptive Kalman filter, and Bi-LSTM.

Optimal data aggregation tree in wireless sensor networks based on improved river formation dynamics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/coin.12132,8,ORIGINAL ARTICLE,Wiley,"data aggregation tree,lifetime,river formation dynamics,wireless sensor network","The restricted energy of nodes is one of the most important challenges in wireless sensor networks. Since data transmissions among nodes consume most of the nodes' energy, thus, minimizing the unnecessary transmissions reduces the consumed energy. One of the sources of this problem is the redundancy of raw data that can be eliminated at the aggregation points. As a result, data aggregation can be considered as an effective strategy to tackle the mentioned issue and to optimize the communication energy consumption. In this paper, the sensor nodes are organized in a tree structure, and the data aggregation are done in intermediate nodes at the junction of tree branches. One of the main characteristics of tree protocols is reduction of energy consumption through optimizing the structure of a data aggregation tree. For this, this paper proposes to apply a swarm intelligent algorithm named river formation dynamics. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms in comparison to the famous ant colony optimization algorithm in terms of network lifetime.

Clustering is an effective way to reduce overheads and when this is aided by effective resource allocation, it results in reduced energy consumption. In this work, a novel hybrid evolutionary algorithm called Bee Algorithm-Simulated Annealing Weighted Minimal Spanning Tree (BASA-WMST) routing is proposed in which randomly deployed sensor nodes are split into the best possible number of independent clusters with cluster head and optimal route. The former gathers data from sensors belonging to the cluster, forwarding them to the sink. The shortest intrapath selection for the cluster is selected using Weighted Minimum Spanning Tree (WMST).

Broad Scope of Site-Specific Crop Management and Specific Role of Remote Sensing Technologies Within It—A Review,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12732,none,REVIEW ARTICLE,Wiley,,"Precision agriculture (PA) has great potential to increase agricultural productivity and profitability while reducing input costs and environmental impacts. Within PA, site-specific crop management (SSCM) is considered the main premise, in which tillage operations and precise crop inputs (such as seed, fertiliser, water, pesticide and agrochemical) are applied according to field variability. The main aim of this review was to highlight the methods and tools used for spatial crop monitoring, soil and weather data influencing crop productivity and to support the adoption of SSCM technology. To achieve this goal: we discussed the main five components of SSCM, methods for monitoring crop and soil data, delineating field management zones (FMZs) and variable rate technologies (VRT) such as precision planting and digital smart sensors used for SSCM application. The review summarised that recent advances in plant and soil sensing systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning should be used in retrieving and analysing GIS big data for optimised crop inputs supply. Within VRT, light-bar systems, automatic controllers and sensors are user-friendly technologies that should be employed in SSCM solution. The authors highlight that adoption of PA can be increased through proper training and education of the farmers, and developing simple, affordable and efficient PA technologies. The review suggests five criteria that should be strictly adopted to get maximum benefits from SSCM: (i) all factors influencing crop yields can be identified; (ii) their effects on crop yields can be determined by using appropriate digital tools and crop modelling; (iii) variable rate crop inputs (VRCIs) should be calculated based on accurate information obtained from plant, soil and environment; (iv) targeted crop inputs should be exercised through global positioning system (GPS) enabled automatic controllers or wireless sensors network (WSN); and (v) right doses of crop inputs (e.g., nitrogen and irrigation) must be applied at the right time and place.",17 July 2024,Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science,"Abid Ali,Muhammad Umair Hassan,Hans-Peter Kaul,","(Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences-DISTAL University of Bologna Bologna Italy),(Research Center on Ecological Sciences Jiangxi Agricultural University Nanchang China),(Department of Crop Sciences, Institute of Agronomy University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU) Tulln Austria),","Austria,China,Italy,Italy"
Performance-Aware Green Algorithm for Clustering of Underwater Wireless Sensor Network Based on Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/1647028,6,Research Article,Wiley,,"Underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) has limited bandwidth, long propagation delays, and unrechargeable batteries, which forces the development of techniques minimizing the energy consumption of UWSNs. One solution is clustering that outperforms in terms of energy optimization and, in addition, can also provide scalability and data reliability. The development of clustering algorithms depends on UWSN architectures. In our case, we have proposed a hybrid UWSN network architecture named ACOP-UWSN (ACoustic OPtical Underwater Wireless Sensor Network), which aims for reliable data transmission at the fastest speed with higher data rates and minimized propagation delays. In ACOP-UWSN, optical sensors sense data, whereas acoustic sensors only relay data towards the surface buoy. Clustering of all these nodes may result in unnecessary wastage of the node’s energy and memory. Therefore, we undergo clustering of only optical sensors, as comparatively, sensing and processing of data consume maximum energy and memory than relaying data. In the proposed clustering algorithm, the criteria for cluster head selection are OSNR (optical signal-to-noise ratio) and residual energy. The mathematical derivation of OSNR for underwater wireless optical communication is a key part of the algorithm. The results achieved using the simulation tool show that our proposed OSNR-based energy efficient clustering algorithm (OECA) is efficient in terms of energy and as well data reliability as compared to state of art. The quantitative analysis of the results showed that the total energy consumed for the existing scheme is 450 J, which is more as compared to 400 J of OECA. Similarly, the residual energy of nodes using OECA is 1% greater than the existing scheme.

Metaheuristic optimization-based clustering with routing protocol in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5914,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"clustering,energy efficiency,network lifetime,routing,wireless sensor networks","In recent years, the use of wireless sensor devices in several applications, for example, monitoring in dangerous geographical spaces and the Internet of Things, has dramatically increased. Though sensor nodes (SNs) have limited power, battery replacement is not feasible in most cases. Therefore, energy saving in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is the major concern in the design of effective transmission protocol. Clustering might lower energy usage and increase network lifetime. Routing protocol for WSN represents an engineering area that has gained considerable interest among researchers due to its rapid evolution and development. Among them, the clustering routing protocol corresponds to the most effective technique to manage the energy consumption of each SN. In this manuscript, we focus on the design of a new metaheuristic optimization-based energy-aware clustering with routing protocol for lifetime maximization (MOEACR-LM) method in WSN. The purpose of the MOEACR-LM method is to improve network efficiency via proper selection of cluster heads (CHs) and effective data transmission. Initially, a hunter–prey optimization (HPO) method-based clustering technique is used for cluster construction and the CH selection process. Next, the clouded leopard optimization (CLO) model is used for the route selection process in WSN. The HPO and CLO models derive a fitness function involving multiple parameters for clustering and routing processes.

After receiving the subtasks, the intracluster sensors carry out its tasks simultaneously and send the results to cluster head sequentially. By removing communication interference between each sensor, reduced task completion time and improved network resource utilization are achieved. Each cluster head simultaneously finishes sending fused data to the SINK after fusing the data obtained from intracluster sensors.

Transmitting an image requires a large amount of energy due to the image size and distance; however, SNs are resource constrained. Image compression is used to scale down image size; however, it is accompanied by a computational complexity trade-off. Moreover, direct image transmission to a BS requires more energy.

Improve Performances of Wireless Sensor Networks for Data Transfer Based on Fuzzy Clustering and Huffman Compression,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/3860682,1,Research Article,Wiley,,"In today’s world, the main challenge is to save use energy optimally. The IoT devices generate a large amount of data for wide applications. Considering the application perspective in the IoT market, in one instance of the IoT technology, that is a wireless sensor network, factors like energy, storage capacity, computation power, and limitations of communication bandwidth resources are the reason for using data fusion. Data fusion and aggregation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) such that minimum energy is consumed are an essential issue. In most clustering models, data aggregation is carried out by the cluster-head (CH). In the proposed algorithm, data aggregation in the cluster-head is carried out using the lossless cascode Huffman compression algorithm. Due to the correlation among data of nodes, the data sensed by each node is compared with the data of the cluster-head node; after removing redundancy, the coded data is transmitted to the main node. The CH node is selected by an algorithm based on fuzzy logic according to the residual energy of the node and the distance of the node from the sink node. Various fuzzy type-I systems of Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno and type-II systems are used. In this paper, the CH selection algorithms are evaluated using three scenarios in terms of the number of live nodes, received packets and CHs, proper distribution rate, and other parameters of the LEACH protocol, network lifetime, and network energy. In the following, to demonstrate the performance of this new algorithm, simulations are performed in MATLAB based on the proposed method. The results show that the proposed compression algorithm in environments with high data correlation improves the compression rate by 8% compared to the conventional Huffman compression, while in environments with low data correlation, these two algorithms perform almost the same.

For the mobile sink, the selection of RP is one of the major problems in WSN. The rendezvous points are only selected based on the local information, so the possibility of selecting an optimal sensor node as RP will be extremely low. The next problem is to find the mobile sink path which visits all the RPs. The above problem is comprehended by utilizing an optimization algorithm. In this paper, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Particle swarm optimization based clustering approach and hybrid Moth-flame cuttlefish optimization (MFO-CFO) algorithm for efficient routing in WSN is proposed. Initially, the number of clusters is formed due to the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) based Ant lion optimization (ALO) clustering approach. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is presented for best cluster head (CH) selection. Here, residual energy (RE), node degree, and histories are considered as an input parameter to find the optimal cluster head. At last, we use hybrid MFO-CFO techniques to find the minimum RPs which decreases energy consumption. The performance metrics of end to end (E2E) delay, energy consumption, channel load, throughput, bit error rate (BER), Network Life Time (NLT), packet delivery ratio (PDR), latency, jitter, and packet loss are computed using several nodes.

IoT includes a variety of communication networks and technologies which facilitate communication between heterogeneous devices. One of the primary challenges of IoT is energy consumption. This paper introduces a new Software Defined Network-based (SDN-based) clustering approach using intelligent algorithms for energy conservation in IoT. The proposed method uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify the required number of clusters and ensures their distribution in the environment. A virtual network is also employed to ensure network coverage and the formation of balanced clusters. Clustering, steady, and routing are the main steps of the proposed method that the clustering step is done in SDN. By expanding the steady phase and leveraging energy-based greedy routing, the network’s lifetime increases. After simulation in MATLAB, the proposed method is tested then the results are compared with other well-known algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed method has improved in terms of metrics such as energy consumption and network lifetime. The proposed approach improves energy consumption by 31%, 28%, 8% and 21% than FPA, MCFL, BEEG and NodeRanked respectively.

However, the escalating occurrences of forest fires, whether of human origin or due to climate change, poses a significant threat to this ecosystem. In recent decades, the emergence of the IoT has been characterised by the utilisation of smart sensors for real-time data collection. IoT facilitates proactive decision-making for forest monitoring, control, and protection through advanced data analysis techniques, including AI algorithms. This research study presents a comprehensive approach to deploying a dynamic and adaptable network topology in forest environments, aimed at optimising data transmission and enhancing system reliability. Three distinct topologies are proposed in this research study: direct transmission from nodes to gateways, cluster formation with multi-step data transmission, and clustering with data relayed by cluster heads. A key innovation is the use of high-powered telecommunication modules in cluster heads, enabling long-range data transmission while considering energy efficiency through solar power. To enhance system reliability, this study incorporates a reserve routing mechanism to mitigate the impact of node or cluster head failures. Additionally, the placement of gateway nodes is optimised using meta-heuristic algorithms, including particle swarm optimisation (PSO), harmony search algorithm (HSA), and ant colony optimisation for continuous domains (ACOR), with ACOR emerging as the most effective. The primary objective of this article is to reduce power consumption, alleviate network traffic, and decrease nodes' interdependence, while also considering reliability coefficients and error tolerance as additional considerations.

Hybrid PSO and Evolutionary Game Theory Protocol for Clustering and Routing in Wireless Sensor Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/8817815,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"Compared with traditional networks, WSNs have more limited resources such as energy, communication, computing, and storage. The problem of how to achieve energy saving, extend network life cycle, and improve network performance under these limited resources has always been an issue of great interest in WSN research. However, existing protocols do not consider that sensor nodes within the BS threshold may not be clustered. These nodes can directly transmit data to the BS. This simplifies the cluster routing process of the entire WSN and saves more energy. This paper introduces an efficient, and energy-efficient, clustering and equalization routing protocol called the PSOLB-EGT protocol. This protocol introduces a new approach by combining improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and evolutionary game theory (EGT) algorithms to address the problem of maximizing the network lifetime. The operation of the wireless sensor network is divided into an initialization phase and a data transmission phase. In the initialization phase of the wireless sensor network, the improved PSO algorithm is used to establish clusters and select CHs in areas other than the BS threshold. Entering the data transmission phase, we analyze this problem from the perspective of game theory. We use improved noncooperative evolutionary game theory to build models to solve the problem of the energy waste caused by routing congestion. The proposed PSOLB-EGT protocol is intensively experimented with a number of topologies in various network scenarios, and the results are compared with the well-known cluster-based routing protocols that include the swarm intelligence-based protocols.

DUCR: Distributed unequal cluster-based routing algorithm for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3374,34,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"clustering,distributed,energy efficiency,hotspot,network lifetime","Designing energy efficient communication protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to conserve the sensors' energy is one of the prime concerns. Clustering in WSNs significantly reduces the energy consumption in which the nodes are organized in clusters, each having a cluster head (CH). The CHs collect data from their cluster members and transmit it to the base station via a single or multihop communication. The main issue in such mechanism is how to associate the nodes to CHs and how to route the data of CHs so that the overall load on CHs are balanced. Since the sensor nodes operate autonomously, the methods designed for WSNs should be of distributed nature, i.e., each node should run it using its local information only. Considering these issues, we propose a distributed multiobjective-based clustering method to assign a sensor node to appropriate CH so that the load is balanced. We also propose an energy-efficient routing algorithm to balance the relay load among the CHs. In case any CH dies, we propose a recovery strategy for its cluster members. All our proposed methods are completely distributed in nature. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and hence prolonging the network lifetime.

In this study, we conducted a controlled laboratory study using combined geochemical and metagenomic approaches to investigate microbial structures and their metabolic pathways under a wide range of nitrate () inputs, saline solutions, and incubation times. These factors served as proxies for land use, salinization of the shallow aquifer, and climate changes. We found a highly reducing habitat and an amplification of genes related to denitrification, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis processes. Core communities consisting of Clostridia, Bacilli, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Desulfobaccia were observed across all treatments. The metabolic prediction of plant-derived organic matter (i.e., tannin and lignin) degradation was not affected by  inputs or salinity because of it being implemented by core communities and the abundance of electron donors and acceptors. Quantification of denitrification genes shows that they are susceptible to  inputs and seawater ions. Long-term incubation allowed sufficient time for microbes to degrade less labile DOM, promoting the re-release of buried solid phase organic matter into the active carbon cycle and increasing the relative abundance of biofilm or spore-forming taxa while decreasing that of rare taxa.

In this paper, a Markov Modulated Bernoulli Prediction Process-based Cluster Head Selection Mechanism (MMBPP-CHSM) is proposed by modeling the success probability of sensor nodes' state into a Bernoulli process that dynamically evolves over time based on Markov chain for extending the lifetime of the network. This proposed MMBPP-CHSM scheme is vital in quantifying the reliability and availability of the sensor nodes in a dynamically evolving wireless sensor network through the estimation of trust and energy in order to facilitate effective cluster head selection.

Increasing lifetime of wireless sensor networks using controllable mobile cluster heads,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcm.763,38,Research Article,Wiley,"connectivity,event data,mobile cluster head,network lifetime,residual energy","In a static wireless sensor network (WSN), sensors close to the base station (BS) run out of energy at a much faster rate than sensors in other parts of the network. This is because the sensor close to the BS always relays the data for other sensors, resulting in an unequal distribution of network residual energy. In this paper, we propose a scheme for enhancing the network lifetime using multiple mobile cluster heads (CHs) that can move in the WSN in a controllable manner. The CH controllably moves toward the energy-rich sensors or the event area, offering the benefits of maintaining the remaining energy more evenly, or eliminating multihop transmission. Therefore, the proposed scheme increases the network lifetime. We theoretically analyze the energy consumption in our scheme and propose three heuristical mobility strategies. We further study the collaboration among CHs in order to maintain their connectivity to the BS to ensure the delay requirement for real-time applications. Simulation shows that network lifetime is increased by upto 75% over existing approach by making CHs always move toward a stable equilibrium point. Our connectivity algorithm provides a best case improvement of 40% in transmission delays over existing schemes.

It is common for them to be battery-powered and responsive to a nearby controller, referred to as the base station. They are capable of doing basic computations and transferring information to the base station in most scenarios. They are also in charge of transporting data from distant nodes, putting a burden on nodes with limited resources, and contributing to the quick depletion of energy in these nodes in the process. Nodes in close proximity to the base station are responsible for more than only detecting and sending data to the base station; they are also responsible for transmitting data from faraway nodes. To reward nodes that perform well, a protocol known as the Improved Fuzzy Inspired Energy Effective Protocol (IFIEEP) employs three separate sorts of nodes in order to provide more energy to those who do not. It takes into account the remaining node energy, the node's proximity to the base station, the node's neighbor concentration, and the node's centrality in a cluster when determining node viability. All of these assumptions are founded on a shaky understanding of the situation. Adaptive clustering must be applied to the most viable nodes in order to identify cluster leaders and transmit data to the base station, in addition to disseminating data across the rest of the network, in order to achieve success. In addition, the research provides proper heterogeneity parameters, which describe, among other things, the number of nodes as well as the starting energy of each node. The percentage gain in-network lifetime when compared to current approaches is minor for smaller numbers of supernodes; however, the percentage gain in the area covered 12.89 percent and 100% when more significant numbers of super nodes are used. These improvements in stability, residual energy, and throughput are accomplished by combining these improvements while also taking into consideration the previously neglected energy-intensive sensing energy aspect.

Hydrological and transport processes thus play a pivotal role in NPS nitrogen pollution. Existing hydro-environmental models for nitrogen pollution often over-simplify the within-watershed processes. It is unclear how such simplification affects the pollution assessment regarding the formation and distribution of denitrification hot spots—which is important for the design of land-based countermeasures. To study this problem, we developed a model, DHSVM-N, and its variant, DHSVM-N_alt. DHSVM-N is developed by integrating nitrogen-related processes of SWAT into a comprehensive process-based hydrological model, the Distributed Hydrology Soil and Vegetation Model (DHSVM). DHSVM-N includes detailed representations of nitrate transport process at a fine spatial resolution with good landscape connectivity to accommodate interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes along the flow travel pathways. Because of the lack of spatially distributed observational data for validation, a model-to-model comparison study is conducted. Through comparison studies on a representative catchment using SWAT, DHSVM-N and DHSVM-N_alt, we quantify the critical roles of hydrological processes and nitrate transport processes in modeling the denitrification process. That is, the capabilities to give reasonable soil moisture estimates and to account for essential processes that take place along flow pathways are keys to simulate denitrification hot spots and their spatial variation.

These sensors are deployed in specific areas to monitor environmental physical parameters. Once the data are collected, it is processed and transmitted to a base station (BS) via designated routes. The processes of sensing and transmitting consume significant energy, leading to rapid depletion of node batteries and the occurrence of hot spot problems. Consequently, relying on a single route for data transmission can result in network overhead issues. Enhancing the energy efficiency of WSNs is a persistent challenge. To address this, improvements in processes, such as routing and clustering are necessary. Implementing dynamic cluster head (CH) selection is a key approach for optimal path selection and energy conservation. Accordingly, in this work, a novel multiobjective CH selection and routing method for providing energy-aware data transmission in WSN is presented. Here, CH selection is carried out using the proposed chronological wild geese optimization (CWGO) technique based on multiple constraints, such as delay, intercluster distance, intracluster distance, Link Life Time (LLT), and predicted energy. Further, the nodes' energy is determined by the deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). Then, the ideal path from the node to the BS is identified by the CWGO considering constraints, like predicted energy, delay, distance, and trust. Moreover, the proposed CWGO is examined considering metrics, like energy, trust, distance, and delay and is found to have attained superior values of 0.963 J, 0.700, 19.468 m, and 0.252 s, respectively.",22 August 2024,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Zoren P.

Paper-based batteries are imperative for stand-alone and self-sustained paper-based electronics. Ideally, paper-based batteries must be simple, biodegradable, inexpensive, and provide realistic and accessible power. Among many paper-based batteries, paper-based microbial biobatteries attract significant attention because of their self-sustainability, cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and potential for energy accessibility in resource-constrained settings. However, the promise of this technology has not translated into practical power applications because of its low performance. Furthermore, its biodegradability remains questionable. In this work, an easily biodegradable paper-polymer substrate is engineered as a part of a novel, high-performance microbial battery. Poly (amic) acid and poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-p-phenylenediamine) are processed and incorporated into a porous, hydrophilic network of intertwined cellulose fibers to revolutionize oxygen-blocking, proton-exchanging, and biodegrading properties of the paper-based microbial biobatteries, which ultimately offer the transformative potential of “green” electronics. Furthermore, the battery, formed by adding engineered polymers to the paper, exhibits a much higher power-to-cost ratio than all previously reported paper-based microbial batteries.

A wide spectrum of optical wireless communication is made available to support 5G and 6G technologies, and it can meet the demands of high-speed optical wireless communication. Trade-offs involving latency, power consumption, deployment costs, and hardware/computational overhead have always been a part of 5G/6G technologies. The decline in the trade-offs indicated above has major implications for networking capacity. The proposed work modulated a new grid-based communication protocol (GCP) with elephant swarm optimization (ESO) to surpass those issues with optical wireless communication devices. This protocol employs an integrated strategy to split the network and choose the cluster head effectively. Different GCP-ESO-related algorithms have been explored. Various components of the OSNs, including network energy usage, cluster, and non-cluster header nodes, are also calculated using mathematical analysis. The results have been simulated using MATLAB software.

[Retracted] Swarm Intelligence with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Based Routing Protocol for Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/7940895,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises numerous compact-sized sensor nodes which are linked to one another. Lifetime maximization of WSN is considered a challenging problem in the design of WSN since its energy-limited capacity of the inbuilt batteries exists in the sensor nodes. Earlier works have focused on the design of clustering and routing techniques to accomplish energy efficiency and thereby result in an increased lifetime of the network. The multihop route selection process can be treated as an NP-hard problem and can be solved by the use of computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms. With this motivation, this article aims to focus on the design of swarm intelligence with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based routing (SI-ANFISR) protocol for clustered WSN. The proposed SI-ANFISR technique aims to determine the cluster heads (CHs) and optimal routes for multihop communication in the network. To accomplish this, the SI-ANFISR technique primarily employs a weighted clustering algorithm to elect CHs and construct clusters. Besides, the SI-ANFISR technique involves the design of an ANFIS model for the selection process, which make use of three input parameters, namely, residual energy, node degree, and node history. In order to optimally adjust the membership function (MF) of the ANFIS model, the squirrel search algorithm (SSA) is utilized. None of the earlier works have used ANFIS with SSA for the routing process. The design of SSA to tune the MFs of the ANFIS model for optimal routing process in WSN shows the novelty of the study. The experimental validation of the SI-ANFISR technique takes place, and the results are inspected under different aspects. The simulation results highlighted the significant performance of the SI-ANFISR technique compared to the recent techniques with a maximum throughput of 43838 kbps and residual energy of 0.4800J, respectively.",13 May 2022,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"Feras Mohammed A-Matarneh,Bassam A.

Cluster Head Selection in a Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Network Ensuring Full Connectivity with Minimum Isolated Nodes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/724219,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"The research work proposes a cluster head selection algorithm for a wireless sensor network. A node can be a cluster head if it is connected to at least one unique neighbor node where the unique neighbor is the one that is not connected to any other node. If there is no connected unique node then the CH is selected on the basis of residual energy and the number of neighbor nodes. With the increase in number of clusters, the processing energy of the network increases; hence, this algorithm proposes minimum number of clusters which further leads to increased network lifetime. The major novel contribution of the proposed work is an algorithm that ensures a completely connected network with minimum number of isolated nodes. An isolated node will remain only if it is not within the transmission range of any other node. With the maximum connectivity, the coverage of the network is automatically maximized. The superiority of the proposed design is verified by simulation results done in MATLAB, where it clearly depicts that the total numbers of rounds before the network dies out are maximum compared to other existing protocols.",12 August 2014,Journal of Sensors,"Tapan Kumar Jain,Davinder Singh Saini,Sunil Vidya Bhooshan,","(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173215, India juit.ac.in),(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173215, India juit.ac.in),(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh 173215, India juit.ac.in),","India,India,India"

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of nodes that transmit data between each other over routing. A variety of routing protocols and algorithms exist, each related to a particular set of conditions. There are a variety of routing algorithms available, some of which can be used in WSNs for routing. The goal of the fastest distance routing algorithms in a WSN is to use the least amount of energy possible. In a WSN, Dijkstra’s algorithm is typically used for shortest path routing. The Floyd–Warshall’s algorithm is used to compute the shortest paths between distinct nodes in a regular graph, but due to the absence of a communication mode, this algorithm is not ideal for routing in wireless networks. In this research work, we have considered a WSN to find out the maximum connectivity time utilizing optimum voltage. On the other hand, duration of connectivity and energy/voltage are two vital parameters that are difficult to manage. Because of limited resources and safety concerns, safety implementation is limited. Also, due to the irregular/hazardous environmental situations, the distance between sensor nodes and its voltage to link up the nodes are totally unpredictable. In this work, we employ triangular fuzzy numbers to express unpredictability. Then, utilizing defuzzification of fuzzy numbers, the associated WSN problem was transformed into a crisp one. The widely used signed distance approach has been applied for the defuzzification of fuzzy numbers in this case.

A Robust Self-Organizing Tree-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5932347,3,Research Article,Wiley,,"For a wireless sensor network (WSN), routing protocols not only affect the reliability and real-time data transmission but also affect the energy consumption of communication and the survival time of the entire network. In this paper, a routing protocol is proposed that combines virtual potential energy with local density of nodes and sleep-wake-up mechanism. The proposed routing protocol is self-organizing and robust. The routing protocol allows nodes to dynamically join or leave the network and enables nodes to automatically transmit information along the shortest path to reach a corresponding sink. The protocol can be applied in scenarios of single sink, multiple sinks, and three-dimensional WSNs. At the same time, the protocol takes a sleep-wake-up mechanism into account, makes a significant decrease in total network traffic, and achieves energy-saving as much as possible.

Despite the significance of WSN, this kind of network faced several issues. The biggest problems rising in WSN are energy consumption and security. Robust security development is needed to cope with WSN applications. For security purposes in WSN, cryptography techniques are very favorable. However, WSN has resource limitations, which is the main problem in applying any security scheme. Hence, if we are using the cryptography scheme in WSN, we must first guarantee that it must be energy-efficient. Thus, we proposed a secure hybrid session key management scheme for WSN. In this scheme, the major steps of public key cryptography are minimized, and much of the operations are based on symmetric key cryptography. This strategy extensively reduces the energy consumption of WSN and ensures optimum security.

Different from the above mentioned algorithms which take clustering as a continuous optimization problem, COCA solves the clustering problem from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Firstly, the clustering of WSN is abstracted into a combinatorial optimization problem. Then, the binary particle coding scheme of cluster head is proposed, which is based on the corresponding relationship between nodes and particle position vectors, and the fitness function is designed according to the parameters used in the process of cluster formation. Finally, the binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to implement the clustering. COCA is validated under different scenarios compared with three other clustering algorithms. The simulation results show that COCA has better performance than its comparable algorithms.",03 July 2020,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Yuxiao Cao,Zhen Wang,","(School of Computer Engineering, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211167, China njit.edu.cn),(School of Information Science and Technology, Huizhou University, Huizhou, Guangdong 516007, China hzu.edu.cn),","China,China"

In most applications, the sensors are battery-powered, and it is necessary to use the energy judiciously to extend their functional duration effectively. Mobile sinks-based data collection is used to extend the lifespan of these networks. However, providing a scalable and effective solution with consideration for multicriteria factors of quality of service and lifetime maximization is still a challenge. This work addresses this problem with a hybrid wireless sensor network with long-term evolution-assisted architecture. The issue of maximizing lifetime and providing multifactor quality of service is solved as a two-stage optimization problem involving clustering and data collection path scheduling. Hybrid meta-heuristics is used to solve the clustering optimization problem. Minimal Steiner tree-based graph theory is applied to schedule the data collection path for sinks. Unlike existing works, the lifetime maximization without QoS degradation is addressed by hybridizing multiple approaches of multicriteria optimal clustering, optimal path scheduling, and network adaptive traffic class-based data scheduling. This hybridization extends the network's lifespan and improves the QoS regarding packet transmission within the proposed solution.

These networks operate on small batteries for days, months, and even years depending on the requirements of monitored applications. The battery-powered operation and inaccessible human terrains make it practically infeasible to recharge the nodes unless some energy-scavenging techniques are used. These networks experience threats at various layers and, as such, are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. The resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes, inaccessible human terrains, and error-prone communication links make it obligatory to design lightweight but robust and secured schemes for these networks. In view of these limitations, we aim to design an extremely lightweight payload-based mutual authentication scheme for a cluster-based hierarchical WSN. The proposed scheme, also known as payload-based mutual authentication for WSNs, operates in 2 steps.

However, while exploiting such applications, the sensor devices being used are made to communicate through multi-hop routing techniques, burdening the relay nodes.

We investigate two network scenarios, that is, when a sink is placed inside the network and otherwise, to give an optimized solution for every case. Further, to mitigate the hot-spot problem, the relay node is selected in a cluster with the same mechanism as CH, which performs the task of data forwarding.

Efficient clusterhead rotation via domatic partition in self-organizing sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcm.662,12,Research Article,Wiley,"wireless sensor networks,domatic partition,clustering,self-organization,energy-efficient protocols","Nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSN) are deployed in an unattended environment with non re-chargeable batteries. Thus, energy efficiency becomes a major design goals in WSNs. Clustering becomes an effective technique for optimization energy in various applications like data gathering. Although aggregation aware clustering addresses lifetime and scalability goals, but suffers from excessive energy overhead at clusterhead nodes. Load balancing in existing clustering schemes often use rotation of clusterhead roles among all nodes in order to prevent any single node from complete energy exhaustion. We considered important aspects of energy and time overhead in rotation of the clusterhead roles in various node clustering algorithms with goals to further prolong the network lifetime by minimizing the energy overheads in rotation setup. The problem of clusterhead rotation is abstracted as the graph-theoretic problem of domatic partitioning, which is also NP-complete. The dense deployment and unattended nature rules out the possibility of manual or external control in existing domatic partition (DP) techniques to be used for WSNs. To our knowledge, no self-organizing technique exists for domatic partitioning. We developed a distributed self-organizing one-domatic partitioning scheme with approximation factor of at least 1/16 for unit-disk-graphs (UDGs). In this work, we demonstrate that the benefits of self-organization is achieved without sacrificing the quality of domatic partitioning. We demonstrated through simulations that our self-organizing DP without sacrificing on the size of DP achieves self-organization capability which is able to reduce time and energy overheads of clusterhead rotation resulting to an improved network lifetime compared to the existing clustering protocols for sensor networks.

Hierarchical Routing with Optimal Clustering Using Fuzzy Approach for Network Lifetime Enhancement in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/6884418,3,Research Article,Wiley,,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the major emerging fields in real-time scenarios due to the features of sensors. Sensors are used in remote areas because of their usability. Energy is the major issue to be addressed in sensor networks. This energy affects the entire network lifetime. To resolve the energy issues of WSN, clustering and proper routing are the two major procedures that have to be focused on. In this paper, hierarchical routing with optimal clustering using a fuzzy system (HROCF) is proposed for network lifetime enhancement in WSNs. This proposed scheme uses two phases: selection of a cluster leader with a fuzzy inference system and the hierarchical routing strategy are implemented for routing to consume the energy of the sensors resourcefully. During the first phase, a proper cluster leader can be nominated through the fuzzy inputs, namely: residual energy, cost, and position. In the second phase, hierarchical routing can communicate the information from the lower region to the sink node through the cluster leaders in higher regions. These two phases help to prolong the lifetime. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the HROCF scheme reduces the overall energy spent in the network and supports an increase in the lifespan in terms of more alive sensors compared to the existing schemes.",25 October 2022,Mobile Information Systems,"R.

A lightweight data transmission reduction method based on a dual prediction technique for sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.4345,6,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,,"An essential design concern in a resource-constraint sensor network is optimizing data transmission for each sensor node (SN) to prolong the network lifetime. Many research works cited that the dual prediction technique remains the most efficient technique for data reduction. A large amount of redundant data is usually transmitted across the network, leading to collisions, loss of data, and energy dissipation. This article proposes a data transmission reduction method (DTRM) to solve these problems, implemented on the cluster heads and operates in rounds. DTRM is lightweight in processing, has low complexity costs, and needs a limited memory footprint, but it is robust and effective. It can be combined with any form of cluster-based data aggregation. We have incorporated the proposed DTRM with the data aggregation-adaptive frame method (DA-AFM), implemented on the SNs within the clusters. DA-AFM can eliminate temporal redundancies and correlations in the sensor's time-series readings. This helps the SN take fewer readings, which improves the efficiency of reducing data transmission and decreases the amount of energy spent during sensing. The proposed DTRM approach decreases the average transmission rates of data while maintaining data quality. This study is evaluated on real data obtained from the Intel Berkeley Lab and compared with three recent data reduction techniques focused on prediction. The results show that DTRM consumes up to 70% less energy while preserving the expected quality of data and reducing transmission.",20 August 2021,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,"Khushboo Jain,Anoop Kumar,","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering Banasthali Vidyapith Tonk India),(Department of Computer Science and Engineering Banasthali Vidyapith Tonk India),","India,India,India"

Such as intelligent agriculture, we have to use the sensor network to obtain the growing environment data of crops and others. However, the difficulty of power supply of wireless nodes has seriously hindered the application and development of Internet of things. In order to solve this problem, people use low-power sleep scheduling and other energy-saving methods on the nodes. Although these methods can prolong the working time of nodes, they will eventually become invalid because of the exhaustion of energy. The use of solar energy, wind energy, and wireless signals in the environment to obtain energy is another way to solve the energy problem of nodes. However, these methods are affected by weather, environment, and other factors, and they are unstable. Thus, the discontinuity work of the node is caused. In recent years, the development of wireless power transfer (WPT) has brought another solution to this problem. In this paper, a three-layer framework is proposed for mobile station data collection in rechargeable wireless sensor networks to keep the node running forever, named TLFW which includes the sensor layer, cluster head layer, and mobile station layer.

On the premise of a comprehensive consideration of all attributes, the corresponding weight of each parameter is assigned by using the direct method of fuzzy engineering theory. Then, each node works out property value. These property values will be mapped to the time axis and be triggered by a timer to broadcast cluster headers. At the same time, the radio coverage method is adopted, in order to avoid collisions and to ensure the symmetrical distribution of cluster heads.

As a WSN is often deployed unattended in areas where replacements of failed sensors are difficult, energy conservation is of primary concern. While the use of redundancy is desirable in terms of satisfying user queries to cope with sensor and transmission faults, it may adversely shorten the lifetime of the WSN, as more sensor nodes will have to be used to answer queries, causing the energy of the system to drain quickly. In this paper, we analyze the effect of redundancy on the mean time to failure (MTTF) of a WSN in terms of the number of queries the system is able to answer correctly before it fails due to either sensor/transmission faults or energy depletion. In particular, we analyze the effect of redundancy on the MTTF of cluster-structured WSNs for energy conservations. We show that a tradeoff exists between redundancy and MTTF.

An appropriate overlapping management system can prolong network lifetime and decrease network recovery time. This paper proposes an intelligent and knowledge-based overlapping clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks, called IKOCP. This protocol uses some of the intelligent and knowledge-based systems to construct a robust overlapping strategy for sensor networks. The overall network is partitioned to several regions by a proposed multicriteria decision-making controller to monitor both small-scale and large-scale areas. Each region is managed by a sink, where the whole network is managed by a base station. The sensor nodes are categorized by various clusters using the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH)-improved protocol in a way that the value of p is defined by a proposed support vector machine–based mechanism. A proposed fuzzy system determines that noncluster heads associate with several clusters in order to manage overlapping conditions over the network. Cluster heads are changed into clusters in a period by a suggested utility function. Since network lifetime should be prolonged and network traffic should be alleviated, a data aggregation mechanism is proposed to transmit only crucial data packets from cluster heads to sinks.

This raises the need for robust recovery mechanism to capture the lost target. However, the problem of recovery of lost target during tracking has received less attention in the literature. In this paper, we present an energy efficient recovery mechanism. The performance of proposed algorithm for lost target recovery using different tracking filters has been evaluated with and without awakening hole boundary nodes. The efficacy of the algorithm has been tested using various causes of losing target with and without energy saving modes. We have conducted exhaustive simulations for recovery of the lost target and presented the analysis of how the recovery gets affected with linear and nonlinear filters.

Multiobjective fuzzy knowledge-based bacterial foraging optimization for congestion control in clustered wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4949,19,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"bacterial foraging optimization,clustering,congestion,fuzzy inference system,routing,wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) include a number of wireless sensor nodes distributed in a geographical area. Due to the intrinsic and functional nature of WSNs, these networks face many challenges such as limited energy resources of sensor nodes and the routing congestions. Clustering is the most common routing approach to control congestion and achieve energy efficiency in WSNs, which ultimately prolongs the network lifetime. In the cluster-based routing protocols, optimal selection of cluster heads (CHs) is an NP-hard problem, and consequently, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms can be employed to obtain a near-optimal solution. In this paper, a fuzzy knowledge-based metaheuristic model based on multiobjective fuzzy inference system (moFIS) and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), named moFIS-BFO, is proposed as an efficient routing protocol for clustered WSNs. In the moFIS-BFO model, the moFIS is utilized to calculate the chance of each node for becoming a CH based on different criteria including degree difference, residual energy, total distance to neighbors, and distance to the base station. Taking into account the calculated chances of nodes, the BFO is employed to select proper CHs at every round. To control the queue in cluster headings, a priority ranking method is used to control congestions and avoid packet wastages. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the moFIS-BFO protocol against the existing techniques to control congestion and prolong the network lifetime.",09 August 2021,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Elaheh Moharamkhani,Behrouz Zadmehr,Saeideh Memarian,Mohammad Javad Saber,Mohammad Shokouhifar,","(Department of Computer Engineering Institute of Higher Education Saeb of Abhar Abhar Iran),(Department of Computer Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology Tehran Iran),(Department of Computer Engineering, Science and Research Branch Islamic Azad University Tehran Iran),(Department of Electrical Engineering Persian Gulf University Bushehr Iran),(Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Shahid Beheshti University Tehran Iran),",
A green cluster-based routing scheme for large-scale wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4375,11,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"dense wireless sensor networks,energy consumption,fuzzy logic,green clustering,network separation","In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), clustering has been shown to be an efficient technique to improve scalability and network lifetime. In clustered networks, clustering creates unequal load distribution among cluster heads (CHs) and cluster member (CM) nodes. As a result, the entire network is subject to premature death because of the deficient active nodes within the network. In this paper, we present clustering-based routing algorithms that can balance out the trade-off between load distribution and network lifetime “green cluster-based routing scheme.” This paper proposes a new energy-aware green cluster-based routing algorithm to preventing premature death of large-scale dense WSNs. To deal with the uncertainty present in network information, a fuzzy rule-based node classification model is proposed for clustering. Its primary benefits are flexibility in selecting effective CHs, reliability in distributing CHs overload among the other nodes, and reducing communication overhead and cluster formation time in highly dense areas.

Aiming at the problem that the energy consumption of each node in the network is uneven in the process of monitoring agricultural production environment by wireless sensor network, which leads to the failure of some nodes in the network too fast, an event-driven wireless routing algorithm for agricultural production environment monitoring is proposed. By reducing the number of pieces of control information sent in the cluster, the algorithm selects the next hop forwarding node from candidate nodes according to the forwarding cost function to shorten the data transmission distance, reduce energy consumption, and improve the life cycle of the entire network. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper effectively avoids the waste of node energy consumption caused by the active transmission mode and at the same time better balances the overall energy consumption of the network and prolongs the life cycle of the network.

Nonuniform Clustering of Wireless Sensor Network Node Positioning Anomaly Detection and Calibration,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5733308,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"In order to detect and correct node localization anomalies in wireless sensor networks, a hierarchical nonuniform clustering algorithm is proposed. This paper designs a centroid iterative maximum likelihood estimation location algorithm based on nonuniformity analysis, selects the nonuniformity analysis algorithm, gives the flowchart of node location algorithm, and simulates the distribution of nodes with MATLAB. Firstly, the algorithm divides the nodes in the network into different network levels according to the number of hops required to reach the sink node. According to the average residual energy of nodes in each layer, the sink node selects the nodes with higher residual energy in each layer of the network as candidate cluster heads and selects a certain number of nodes with lower residual energy as additional candidate cluster heads. Then, at each level, the candidate cluster heads are elected to produce the final cluster heads. Finally, by controlling the communication range between cluster head and cluster members, clusters of different sizes are formed, and clusters at the level closer to the sink node have a smaller scale. By simulating the improved centroid iterative algorithm, the values of the optimal iteration parameters α and η are obtained. Based on the analysis of the positioning errors of the improved centroid iterative algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, the value of the algorithm conversion factor is selected. Aiming at the problem of abnormal nodes that may occur in the process of ranging, a hybrid node location algorithm is further proposed. The algorithm uses the ℓ2, 1 norm to smooth the structured anomalies in the ranging information and realizes accurate positioning while detecting node anomalies. Experimental results show that the algorithm can accurately determine the uniformity of distribution, achieve good positioning effect in complex environment, and detect abnormal nodes well.

Efficient Data Collection in UAV-Assisted Cluster-Based Wireless Sensor Networks for 3D Environment: Optimization Study,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9513868,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently employed in combination with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to collect data efficiently and improve surveillance effectiveness. This integration enhances the WSN infrastructure where UAVs are used as aerial base stations from which to access wireless sensors in hard-to-reach places within surveillance area. Consequently, the UAVs have become a promising solution to maintain reliability for the communication between wireless sensors and base station particularly in cases where infrastructure becomes unavailable such as hilly terrains and emergencies. However, UAVs encounter many challenges which mainly focus on their lifespan and efficient placement that improves the coverage and data collection. In this paper, a novel optimization study is presented to improve the lifespan of UAV-assisted cluster-based WSNs deployed in 3D environment. This optimization study is based on two algorithms: (1) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is employed to address the clustering problem in the WSN and (2) Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is employed to locate an efficient UAV placement to maximize the lifetime. The UAV-WSN system is evaluated by considering two metrics: lifetime and throughput. The simulation results show that varying UAV altitude has significant impact on both lifetime and throughput especially in the presence of different terrain. With increasing altitude, lifetime and throughput decrease as this loss can be as high as 94%. However, the proposed optimization plays a major role in combating these losses by redirecting the UAV to efficient placement corresponding to the new altitude level to maintain maximum lifetime and throughput. Moreover, the system lifetime concerning efficient UAV placement outperforms the one concerning centered placement at lower altitude, while the difference between two cases becomes less at higher altitude. Thereby, these outcomes may provide interesting measures for designing such integrated systems to achieve efficient data collection.",12 April 2023,Journal of Sensors,"Amjad Abu-Baker,Hazim Shakhatreh,Ahmad Sawalmeh,Ali H.

Its cost-efficiency and functional robustness towards low-power lossy networks make it suitable for internet-of-things (IoT) applications.

Cost savings were greater when more traps were included in the network, but declined as rates of sprung traps increased.

Resource Scheduling Based on Unequal Clustering in Internet of Things,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/1810704,none,Research Article,Wiley,,"Resource scheduling in a fair and efficient manner is a significant challenge in the Internet of Things. Although unequal clustering is an effective technique for alleviating the “energy holes” problem in multihop communication, resource scheduling based on unequal clustering is scarcely conducted. In the present study, a new resource scheduling based on unequal clustering in the Internet of Things (RSUC) is proposed. In RSUC, unequal clustering and multihop routing are considered, and the “energy holes” problem is alleviated effectively. RSUC includes resource scheduling of intracluster communication and intercluster communication. In resource scheduling of intracluster communication, according to the threshold of the number of cluster members, the cluster heads (CHs) recycle resources of failed nodes. In resource scheduling of intercluster communication, CHs in the different layers based on transmission chain obtain different sending and receiving time slots. In RSUC, CHs that are near the base station (BS) have fewer intracluster communication time slots and more intercluster communication time slots. Clusters that are further away from the BS end intercluster communication earlier and enter into intracluster communication instead of waiting for all CHs to complete intercluster communication.

A Hybrid Structure for Data Aggregation  in Wireless Sensor Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/395868,7,Research Article,Wiley,,"In recent years, wireless sensor networks have been used for various applications such as environmental monitoring, military and medical applications. A wireless sensor network uses a large number of sensor nodes that continuously collect and send data from a specific region to a base station. Data from sensors are collected from the study area in the common scenario of sensor networks. Afterward, sensed data is sent to the base station. However, neighboring sensors often lead to redundancy of data. Transmission of redundant data to the base station consumes energy and produces traffic, because process is run in a large network. Data aggregation was proposed in order to reduce redundancy in data transformation and traffic. The most popular communication protocol in this field is cluster based data aggregation. Clustering causes energy balance, but sometimes energy consumption is not efficient due to the long distance between cluster heads and base station. In another communication protocol, which is based on a tree construction, because of the short distance between the sensors, energy consumption is low. In this data aggregation approach, since each sensor node is considered as one of the vertices of a tree, the depth of tree is usually high. In this paper, an efficient hierarchical hybrid approach for data aggregation is presented. It reduces energy consumption based on clustering and minimum spanning tree. The benefit of combining clustering and tree structure is reducing the disadvantages of previous structures. The proposed method firstly employs clustering algorithm and then a minimum spanning tree is constructed based on cluster heads. Our proposed method was compared to LEACH which is a well-known data aggregation method in terms of energy consumption and the amount of energy remaining in each sensor network lifetime.

Based on these context data, the SMOCS judges the safety of the working environment primarily. If it perceives a dangerous sign, it requests additional bursty data such as still image or video streaming from a particular sensor device in order to confirm the situation. Because these bursty data have to be delivered to the server reliably with time constraints, it is challengeable to process those data with limited energy and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to deliver bursty data reliably by reserving time slots to transmit the required packets on all the paths from the selected multimedia nodes to the server. The nodes that are not on the selected paths are put into sleep mode to conserve energy during the transmission of bursty data.

The limited battery of sensor nodes (SNs) has generated a tremendous challenge for the researchers to ameliorate the network's life span. To pacify this concern, in this paper, we have proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based dual sink mobility (PSODSM) technique to reduce the energy expenditure of the SNs. PSODSM has the paramount focus on the cluster head (CH) selection based on integration of crucial factors: “ratio of remaining energy to the initial energy,” node degree, node centrality, separation factor between the SN and the sink, CH number, and energy consumption rate. As soon as the CHs are selected, two sinks placed opposite to each other are made to move towards the selected CHs for data collection. The most prominent fact is the movement of sinks which is done outside the periphery of the network to collect data rather than the reported conventional research works that employ sink mobility inside the network. Extensive simulations are performed to examine the empirical evaluation of PSODSM based on the benchmark of different performance metrics. The performance validation of PSODSM is done against the other meta-heuristic algorithms, and findings show that the PSODSM outperforms the competitive algorithms and is also found to be scalable pertaining to real time implementation.",23 August 2020,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Supreet Kaur,Vinit Grewal,","(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering Guru Nanak Dev University, Regional Campus Jalandhar 144007 India),(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering Guru Nanak Dev University, Regional Campus Jalandhar 144007 India),","India,India"

Sensor nodes transmit through an open medium and due to the short communication range of each sensor node, a node may need to transmit through many hops to a final destination. Denial-of-service (DoS) is one of the attacks that can be launched against WSNs to prevent legitimate nodes from transmitting/receiving data packets. Developing an attack detection and countermeasure system to mitigate the effect of DoS is not an easy task. This work proposes lightweight models for DoS attack detection in WSNs. We developed different lightweight models and algorithms for the detection and elimination of DoS in WSNs and experimented the same. The performance of data delivery ratio, delay, detection rate, energy consumption, and false-positive was carried out.

It is well known that the radio is the most energy demanding part of the node. Therefore, efficient communications are imperative to increase the network lifetime. However, many issues arise in practical WSNs implementations because of the uncertainty and dynamics of the environment and the complexity constraints of the nodes. Routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) is one of the most widely implemented routing strategies because it deals with many of these practical issues. Unfortunately, this protocol does not adapt the nodes' transmission power nor the nodes' transmission channel. Nowadays, commercial motes have multi-power and multi-channel capabilities, and these can be used to reduce the network consumption and avoid the high collision probability that may arise in convergecast networks. In this paper, we enhance RPL to obtain a joint routing, transmission power control and channel allocation solution for real-life WSNs. Two different strategies (minimum aggregated power and maximum probability delivery ratio) are designed and implemented in a WSN testbed with commercial motes. They are compared with the original RPL and also with other standard routing protocols, such as the routing strategy adopted in ZigBee. The experimental results show that the network performance is improved both in terms of reliability and energy consumption.

The wireless sensor network based on the scale-free theory has strong fault tolerance when random nodes fail and can better adapt to the unsupervised and complex environment of wireless sensor networks. However, in a wireless sensor network with scale-free function, the unevenness of its degree distribution causes some nodes to be very critical in the network. Once attacked, it will cause major damage to the network. Selective promotion attacks are relatively common. At the network level, the attacker destroys the normal collection of network data by selectively losing information or not forwarding sensitive information, which is extremely harmful to the network using this function. In order to overcome the influence of excessive dependence on a single path on the balance performance of the network, starting from the entire network, a secure multi-path routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on scale-free topology is proposed. Through the analysis of the network topology, the highest degree network node can be found. Optimize the load factor, use digital watermarking technology to locate the network path packet loss rate, and perform Gaussian modeling on the packet loss rate. Then the routing loading function and the routing packet loss rate are used as the confidence model factors to create the routing confidence model. We must first establish a model, select the transmission path according to the received function, and then obtain the global optimal security sensor routing algorithm. Through the algorithm in this thesis, the security of the wireless sensor network is improved by 17%.",16 April 2021,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Zhiyang Gao,Yaqi Liu,Feng Qi,Huaijin Chen,","(College of Electronic Engineering National University of Defense Technology Hefei China),(College of Electronic Engineering National University of Defense Technology Hefei China),(College of Electronic Engineering National University of Defense Technology Hefei China),(College of Electronic Engineering National University of Defense Technology Hefei China),","China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China"
An approach for provisioning virtual sensors in sensor clouds,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nem.2062,6,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,,"In sensor clouds environments, the provisioning process is a crucial task since it is responsible for selecting physical sensors that will be used to create virtual sensors. However, most works consider the allocation of all sensors within the region of interest, causing serious problems such as the wasting of energy consumption. The objective of this paper is to present ACxSIM, an automatic approach to the provisioning of virtual sensors. ACxSIM includes two algorithms: adaptive clustering algorithm based on similarity (ACASIM) and ant colony optimization for sensor selection based on similarity (ACOSIM). ACASIM first clusters the sensor nodes based on the similarity of its measurements (exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations between them), which may create clusters with nodes not physically close to each other. Therefore, in ACASIM, a cluster represents different geographical areas whose nodes have correlated measurements (according to a defined error threshold). Later, ACOSIM, based on ant colony optimization algorithm, creates virtual sensors by selecting only a subset of nodes from each cluster. In this way, the overall energy consumption of sensor nodes is reduced, prolonging the lifetime of the sensor cloud. Results from experiments in Intel Lab dataset show that the ACxSIM reduces energy consumption by 73.97%, providing a solution to be considered in sensor cloud scenarios.",08 January 2019,International Journal of Network Management,"Marcus Lemos,Ricardo Rabelo,Douglas Mendes,Carlos Carvalho,Raimir Holanda,","(Computer Science Department State University of Piaui Teresina Brazil),(Graduate Program in Applied Informatics University of Fortaleza Fortaleza Brazil),(Graduate Program in Computer Science Federal University of Piaui Teresina Brazil),(Graduate Program in Computer Science Federal University of Piaui Teresina Brazil),(Computer Science Department State University of Piaui Teresina Brazil),","Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil,Brazil"

Owing to several factors like nodes with resources that are constrained and packages that are resistant to tamper, WSNs are tremendously vulnerable to internal attacks and mainly external attacks also. Attacks on such critical schemes comprise penetrations into their network along with the installation of malicious tools or programs, which can reveal sensitive data or alter the specific physical equipment's behavior. For their action, the wireless networks are utilized by the threats like spoofing, injection, denial of services, and numerous attacks. Thus, for protecting devices from intruder attacks, security solutions are necessary. An intrusion detection system (IDS), which is wielded for detecting attacks against a system or a network by evaluating their activities along with events, is a tool. In this article, an efficient attack detection technique grounded on exponential polynomial kernel-centered deep neural networks (EPK-DNN) is proposed since intrusion detection is crucial in securing the data. Intrusion detection in WSN is extremely intricate for tasks like fault diagnosis, and real-time monitoring applications, owing to the WSN's dynamicity. To find diverse attacks along with to safeguard WSNs from security risks, numerous detection methodologies are created, because intrusion detection is decisive for protecting the data in WSNs. However, owing to the restricted resources and energy of WSN nodes, widespread computation and so forth, they are inefficient. In this article, an efficient attack detection methodology centered on EPK-DNN is proposed to lessen these problems. The attack detection system's training is the foremost step in the EPK-DNN technique. In step one, the input data are preprocessed; and then, in the training process, the preprocessed data are exploited for attribute extraction. In step two, by utilizing the linear scaling based BAT optimization (LS-BAT), the major attributes are chosen. Then, to detect attacks in WSN, the chosen features are trained by the EPK-DNN. In step three, by utilizing the Damerau-Levenshtein-based K-means algorithm (DL-K-Means), the WSN network is initialized along with the sensor nodes are clustered.

"A Comprehensive Survey on Hierarchical-Based Routing Protocols for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: Review, Taxonomy, and Future Directions",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/2818542,106,Review Article,Wiley,,"Introducing mobility to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) puts new challenges particularly in designing of routing protocols. Mobility can be applied to the sensor nodes and/or the sink node in the network. Many routing protocols have been developed to support the mobility of WSNs. These protocols are divided depending on the routing structure into hierarchical-based, flat-based, and location-based routing protocols. However, the hierarchical-based routing protocols outperform the other routing types in saving energy, scalability, and extending lifetime of Mobile WSNs (MWSNs). Selecting an appropriate hierarchical routing protocol for specific applications is an important and difficult task. Therefore, this paper focuses on reviewing some of the recently hierarchical-based routing protocols that are developed in the last five years for MWSNs. This survey divides the hierarchical-based routing protocols into two broad groups, namely, classical-based and optimized-based routing protocols. Also, we present a detailed classification of the reviewed protocols according to the routing approach, control manner, mobile element, mobility pattern, network architecture, clustering attributes, protocol operation, path establishment, communication paradigm, energy model, protocol objectives, and applications. Moreover, a comparison between the reviewed protocols is investigated in this survey depending on delay, network size, energy-efficiency, and scalability while mentioning the advantages and drawbacks of each protocol. Finally, we summarize and conclude the paper with future directions.",10 January 2017,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Nabil Sabor,Shigenobu Sasaki,Mohammed Abo-Zahhad,Sabah M.

A modified whale-dragonfly algorithm and self-adaptive cuckoo search-based clustering strategy for augmenting network lifetime in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5482,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"cluster router (CR),clustering,energy stability,modified whale-dragonfly optimization algorithm (MWDOA),self-adaptive cuckoo search (SACS)","Designing an energy efficient and durable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a key challenge as it personifies potential and reactive functionalities in harsh antagonistic environment at which wired system deployment is completely infeasible. Majority of the clustering mechanisms contributed to the literature concentrated on augmenting network lifetime and energy stability. However, energy consumption incurred by cluster heads (CHs) are high and thereby results in minimized network lifetime and frequent CHs selection. In this paper, a modified whale-dragonfly optimization algorithm and self-adaptive cuckoo search-based clustering strategy (MWIDOA-SACS) is proposed for sustaining energy stability and augment network lifetime. In specific, MWIDOA-SACS is included for exploiting the fitness values that aids in determining two optimal nodes that are selected as optimal CH and cluster router (CR) nodes in the network. In MWIDOA, the search conduct of dragon flies is completely updated through whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for preventing load balancing at CHs. It minimized the overhead of CH by adopting CHs and CR for collecting information from cluster members and transmitting the aggregated data from CHs to the base station (BS). It included self-adaptive cuckoo search (SACS) for achieving sink mobility using radius, energy stability, received signal strength, and throughput for achieving optimal data transmission process after partitioning the network into unequal clusters. Simulation experiments of the proposed MWIDOA-SACS confirmed better performance in terms of total residual energy by 21.28% and network lifetime by 26.32%, compared to the competitive CH selection strategies.",24 March 2023,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Sebasthiyar Jaya Pratha,Valayapathy Asanambigai,Seenapuram Rajan Mugunthan,","(Research Scholar, Department of CSE, Faculty of Engineering and Technology Annamalai University Chidambaram India),(Research Scholar, Department of CSE, Faculty of Engineering and Technology Annamalai University Chidambaram India),(Department of CSE Dr. N.G.P.
