A Cognitive Multi-hop Clustering Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-016-3200-5,24,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Clustering,Fuzzy logic,Multi-hop network,Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) exert a pull on the modern research community towards many design challenges,
 especially, constraints on their lifetimes. Solutions proposed to save energy in WSNs posses their own merits and limitations. The trends evolved from the perspective of improving performance and scalability of conventional clustering approaches. They emerge by adopting cognitive techniques to handle uncertainty and instability present in the application atmosphere. This paper proposes a clustering approach for WSNs, namely, energy aware fuzzy clustering algorithm (EAFCA) which achieves lifetime enhancement in CH election, data aggregation and inter-cluster traffic phases of a multi-hop WSN environment. This algorithm contributes the process of cluster head (CH) election in a cluster in an energy-efficient manner by considering the residual energy, mean distance to 1-hop neighbors and 2-hop coverage of the competing nodes. The elected CH aggregates the data from all the sensor nodes of its cluster and forwards the same to the base station. Performance evaluation of the proposed EAFCA is done with popular clustering algorithms and the experimental results show improvement in terms of lifetime of WSNs under first node dies and half of the nodes alive scenarios.",12 February 2016,Wireless Personal Communications,"I.

The functionality of IoT depends on the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) design. The IoT-empowered WSNs received the researcher's attention for the Smart Farming (SF) applications. SF nowadays is required to enhance farm productivity while minimizing the cost and resources. The agriculture sensors devices disposed over the farm collect the on-field farm data and transfer it wirelessly to the base station for decision-making and agriculture monitoring. As the nodes are resource restrained, the process of periodic farm data gathering and multi-hop delivery needs to be effective in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and energy-efficiency of information transmission by reflecting the long-distance transmission difficulties of SF applications. To enhance the network lifetime substantially of densely deployed WSN for periodically monitoring of farm conditions, we propose a novel Nature-Inspired algorithm-based Cross-layer Clustering (NICC) protocol. We design NICC to find a reasonably better solution for clustering and routing in SF applications. NICC explores the idea of a nature-inspired optimization algorithm called Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) with optimal fitness function, which models the trade-off among the energy efficiency and optimal data transmission. We design a BFO algorithm to select the optimal sensor node for clustering and routing problems based on cross-layer parameters-based fitness value computation. The cross-layer parameter includes the sensor parameters from layers like network layer, physical layer, and Medium Access Control (MAC). The numerical results show the superiority of the NICC protocol for various WSN-assisted SF scenarios against state-of-art clustering techniques.",18 August 2021,Wireless Personal Communications,"Hemant B.

A Comprehensive Review on Scheduling Based Approaches for Target Coverage in WSN,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-021-09281-7,7,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Target coverage,Energy efficiency,Node scheduling,Quality of service,Reliability,Trust","Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an emerging research field in recent years. The advancement in sensory device and communication technologies has enabled the deployment of diverse sensor networks such as random network consisting of thousand sensors or carefully deployed deterministic network. Despite the plethora of applicability of sensor networks, there are some limitations too such as energy efficiency, lifetime, coverage, localization etc. As the sensor nodes are battery driven so conservation of energy becomes crucial in the hazardous applications. Coverage is also considered as the major quality of service (QoS) metric which aim to maximize the observation quality of the target region. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the coverage problem but most of the approaches have the same objective to achieve the maximum lifetime while ignoring the QoS parameters. The real world applications of WSN require addressing of several QoS parameters too such as reliability, throughput, delay in packet transmission etc. This review paper provides the exhaustive study of the coverage problem concepts, issues and challenges. The paper provides the classification of coverage approaches especially related to that of target coverage. The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of different categories of target coverage approaches.

WSN combined with other advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings automation via the sensing, transmitting, and monitoring steps. However, the cyber threats such as Malware, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS), and Man in the Middle (MitM), etc. limits the potential of such networks. Several security methods were introduced in last decade to protect the WSN from various cyber threats; however, due to resource-constrained sensor nodes, designing the energy-efficient security algorithm for WSN is a widely studied research problem. In the proposed work, a novel Nature-inspired Decision Support System for Secure Clustering (NIDSC) is proposed to overcome the security issues with minimum resource consumptions and computational overhead. In NIDSC, a hybrid trust model is designed to evaluate each sensor node before selecting Cluster Head (CH) by measuring various sensor node parameters, to achieve a reliable decision support system which classifies each node as either legitimate or attacker. Later, the proposed decision support system along with clustering optimization is formulated for CH selection using a natural evolution-based hybrid trust model. Due to its fast convergence over other optimization algorithms, the nature-inspired Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used to perform Decision Support System (DSS) for optimal and secure WSN clustering. The proposed method is a lightweight trust-based decision-making method for Quality of Service (QoS) clustering to establish secure data transmission in intra-cluster and/or inter-cluster communication. The simulation is carried out to analyze and compare the performance of the proposed method with the existing works such as Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH), Trust Management System (TMS), and Energy-efficient Trusted Moth Flame Optimization and Genetic Algorithm based clustering algorithm(eeTMFO/GA).

Clustering provides a practical solution to improve energy efficiency. However, the loads of each cluster head are not balance. Thus, the energy cannot be consumed evenly in each cluster head. To overcome this problem, we propose a distributed load balancing clustering algorithm (DLBCA). Without relying on central nodes, the sensor nodes can separately determine their roles (cluster heads or cluster members) and the clustering structure. The determination of cluster heads is based on the residual energy of sensor nodes and the distance to other nodes.

Thus, a hierarchical energy-saving routing algorithm based on fuzzy logic was constructed by considering three aspects: residual energy value, centrality, and distance value between nodes and base stations. The remaining sensor nodes selected by fuzzy logic algorithm have a longer time to live and greater residual energy than those selected by low-power adaptive clustering hierarchical protocol algorithm, fuzzy unequal clustering algorithm, and fuzzy logic cluster head election algorithm. For network life cycle, the number of rounds in which the first dead node appears, in descending order, is studied: energy-saving routing algorithm (400 rounds) > new geographic cellular structure algorithm (300 rounds) > virtual grid based dynamic routes adjustment algorithm (100 rounds). Under the same experimental round, energy-saving routing algorithm’s remaining energy curve always reaches its maximum.

Jensen–Shannon Divergence Based Independent Component Analysis to Detect and Prevent Black Hole Attacks in Healthcare WSN,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-019-06347-5,21,article,Springer,"Black hole attack,Cooperative count,Energy,Healthcare WSN,Isolation,Jensen–Shannon Divergence,Sensor node,Trust value","The black hole attack is an adverse issue in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Research for detection and circumvention of the black hole attack is underway. However, the false alarm rate, amount of time required to identify the black hole attack nodes in network has not reduced. To overcome such limitations, the Jensen–Shannon Divergence Based Independent Component Analysis (JDICA) technique is proposed in this paper. This technique is introduced with the application of Jensen–Shannon Divergence estimation in Independent Component Analysis model on the contrary to existing works, in order to achieve higher black hole detection accuracy in healthcare WSN. The JDICA technique identifies the black hole attack by analyzing the physiological data gathered from biomedical sensors. The proposed JDICA technique carries out attack detection based on sensor nodes behaviors such as energy, trust and cooperative count. It determines the dependence among the nodes, based on the independent probability distribution functions and mutual probability function by using the Jensen–Shannon Divergence. The divergence result enables JDICA technique to detect black hole attacks with greater accuracy, and helps to quarantine the malicious node from the network by broadcasting the isolation message to all sensor nodes in the network. Hence, JDICA technique enhances the detection of black hole attack nodes as compared to state-of-the-art works, thereby increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing delay. The JDICA technique simulation is done considering the metrics such as detection rate, detection time, false alarm rate, and packet delivery ratio with respect to a varied number of sensor nodes and data packets.

One of the technologies that are used for networking is known as a wireless sensor network. In this type of network, sensor nodes are linked together using wireless communication methods. A random and haphazard dispersal of nodes is carried out during the deployment procedure inside the network region. This distribution is carried out throughout the network. The consequence of this is that the distances that separate the nodes do not stay the same. However, the nodes have a severely limited battery life and a restricted range of perception, despite the fact that they have a great sensing capacity. All nodes inside their respective sensing regions may sense the wireless data. A unique routing protocol is essential to increase throughput and Quality of Service (QoS), which will help resolve these problems and improve WSN performance. The Dijkstra method was most frequently used by researchers to discover the shortest route. However, it is not more flexible in terms of WSN routing. The Floyd-Warshall (FW) technique is also employed to choose the shortest path. However, in the current WSN, varied sensors are dispersed throughout several sites and convey data to various coordinators, who are likewise dispersed across countless sites. As a result, the FW technique must be modified to discover the shortest path among any two nodes. In this study, the Improved Floyd-warshall (IFW) algorithm is proposed. Data structures like adjacency lists and sparse vectors are used by the IFW method to describe the WSN graph. When sparse WSNs need less memory, this helps make that possible. The Floyd-Warshall method, which figures out distances between nodes in a network based on their actual lengths, can get even better by adding location information. Using the LEACH method to split the network into smaller groups makes the network more manageable. The LEACH method is then used directly in each cluster to improve both scaling and processing speed. This is done so that the goals can be met. The computer can also handle situations where there is not a legal way to connect two nodes, and it can handle information going both ways between nodes.",26 June 2024,Earth Science Informatics,Amani K.

This paper proposes a technique to energy-efficient clustering based on fuzzy logic (FLEE). Energy consumption is a significant barrier for geographically dispersed wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Because of the rapid improvement of energy harvesting technology, a novel approach known as simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) has emerged as a hot research topic due to its use in tackling the energy scarcity problem in WSNs.

In this paper, we provide a novel Fuzzy Logic-based Energy Efficient—SWIPT approach for adaptively dividing data packets into energy data packets and information data packets using fountain codes and real-time node decoding status information.

Hence, extending the lifetime of WSN is a major concern, which directly impacts the performance of various WSN-based applications. In this regard, various methods have been developed that either investigate the energy consumption or lifetime enhancement of WSN. A promising method to conserve the energy of the sensors is to use sleep–awake scheduling by choosing disjoint groups of nodes called dominating set (DS). By distributing the data collection duties among these DSs, one DS handles these tasks for a specified period of time before being replaced by another group, extending the lifespan of the network. This problem becomes challenging in WSN with heterogeneous energy. Despite the success of the algorithms in determining the DS, none of the existing methods consider the node’s energy while creation or selection of DS. This motivates us to utilize the DSs concept to control and maintain sleep/awake schedule of WSN nodes with heterogeneous energy. Toward this goal, we propose an energy-aware algorithm known as proposed initializer for whale optimization algorithm-based operator (PI-WOA-BO) to construct disjoint DSs that work as collector nodes for data gathering in each round and extend the total WSN lifetime. An energy-aware fitness function is introduced for selecting the best DSs that can maximize the WSN lifetime.

Since communication offers a vast place in the consumption of energy, effective routing is the best solution to handle this problem. The lifetime improvement is an important problem since the majority of the WSNs function in an unattended environment, in which monitoring, as well as human access, is not possible in a practical manner. Clustering is one of the powerful approaches, which arranges the system operation for the enhanced lifetime of the network, improves energy efficiency, reduces the consumption of energy, and also attend the scalability of the network. To handle this issue, the present researchers have considered the usage of various clustering algorithms. Yet, the cluster head is burdened by the majority of the suggested algorithms in the process of cluster formation. To handle this problem, this paper plans to develop the energy-efficient clustering for WSN using the improved LEACH protocol. Here, the concept of a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm is used for the optimal cluster head selection through energy-efficient clustering. The optimal solutions are rated based on the multi-objective function considering the objective constraints like energy, distance, delay, quality of service (QoS), load, and time of death. Communication between the sink node and cluster head uses the distance of separation as a parameter for reducing energy consumption. Two well-performing algorithms, like salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) are merged to develop the proposed hybrid algorithm called salp-swarm grasshopper optimization (SS-GO). From the results, for 200 nodes, the normalized energy of SS-GO at 1400th round is 5.41%, 11.43%, 14.71%, and 25.81%, superior to GOA, SSO, O-EHO, and FU-CSA, respectively.

The retrieval of WSN data can yield better results through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), for example, concerning the increase in the amount of data collected and the decrease in the time between the collection and use of the data. In particular, disaster areas may be left without communication resources and with high residual risk to humans, at which point a WSN can be quickly launched by air to collect relevant data until other measures can be established. The set of rules of each problem’s component (e.g., number of UAVs, UAVs dislocation control, sensors, communication) is considered the approaches to solve the problem. In this meaning, some studies present approaches for the use of UAVs for the collection of WSN data, focusing primarily on optimizing the path to be covered by a single UAV and relying on long-range communication that is always available; these studies do not explore the possibility of using several UAVs or the limitations on the range of communication. This work describes DADCA, a distributed scalable approach capable of coordinating groups of UAVs in WSN data collection with restricted communication range and without the use of optimization techniques. The results reveal that the amount of data collected by DADCA is similar or superior to path optimization approaches by up to 1%. In our proposed approach, the delay in receiving sensor messages is up to 46% shorter than in other approaches, and the required processing onboard UAVs can reach less than 75% of those using optimization-based algorithms.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological paradigm that encompasses embedded systems, wireless sensors, and automation, facilitating the integration of various applications ranging from smart homes to wearable devices. In addition, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) amplifies this influence by providing data-driven analytics, optimising processes, and presenting novel opportunities for growth. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of devices within Internet of Things (IoT) networks gives rise to apprehensions regarding increased energy consumption. In order to ensure the longevity of network operations, it is imperative to employ energy-efficient protocols for sensor nodes that possess limited power resources.

Sensor nodes are usually powered by battery. Consequently, the energy efficiency is critical for the lifetime of the Wireless sensors network. Routing protocols are the most important issue for WSNs. LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) is one of the first hierarchical routing algorithms for WSNs. LEACH-C (LEACH-centralized) is a variant of LEACH where the cluster heads are selected by the Sink. At the beginning of each round in LEACH-C, the sensor nodes must send information about their current energy to the Sink, which exhausts the sensor node battery. This paper proposes an improved LEACH-C algorithm in which, the Sink uses a consumption mode for each sensor node (CMSN) to estimate the amount of energy needed for the next rounds; so, sensor nodes doesn’t have to send the value of the current energy to the Sink at the beginning of each round.

Adaptive and Dynamic Mechanism for Round Length Determination in Cluster Based Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-020-07413-z,8,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs),Bezier curves,Criticality level,Round length","The resource-constrained nature of WSNs require efficient use of resources, especially energy, to prolong their lifetime. Clustering is one of the popular approaches to allocate the resources efficiently among the WSN nodes. In this work, we analyze the problem of round length determination in cluster based WSN which has severe impact on the energy efficiency. This problem is very important since round length determines how often the cluster head (CH) rotates or re-clustering process occurs. A longer round length will cause the CH nodes to operate for a long time and drain their energies faster than other nodes resulting in uneven energy consumption in the network, while a shorter round length results in considerable wastage of energy due to frequent running of the setup phase. Hence, we propose an adaptive and dynamic mechanism for round length determination in cluster based WSNs by adapting Behavior Curve Function modeled by quadratic Bezier curves, where we associate the remaining energy level of the cluster to its round operation length and to its assigned criticality which is defined based on network energy level. This helps to determine the number of frames in a round or how many times the data collection occurs in a cluster in a round and the criticality of the energy in the WSN.

A Dummy Packet-Based Hybrid Security Framework for Mitigating Routing Misbehavior in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-018-5778-2,13,article,Springer,"Acknowledgment based approach,Trust mechanism,Routing misbehavior,Packet dropping attacks,Secure routing,Wireless networks","Wireless networks have emerged as a key enabling technology, expanding rapidly and offers numerous potential applications. The security issues have to be adequately addressed to realize the potential of multi-hop cooperative wireless network scenarios. The open nature of the wireless network is the opportunity for invaders launching various attacks with minimum effort owing to the multi-hop scenario of routing protocols. Routing protocols work based on the assumption that intermediate nodes are cooperating and well-behaving. Even in the presence of strong authentication mechanisms, detecting the continuous and selective packet dropping attack is a challenging process. This paper focuses on the design of a secure routing framework, and extend it to the routing protocols of various multi-hop wireless networks vulnerable to such attacks. The proposed hybrid security framework combats the routing misbehavior attacks in the presence of a wide range of malicious nodes. The proposed framework extends the hybrid security model adaptable to various multi-hop wireless networks with flexible routing overhead. The framework introduces a dummy packet based acknowledgment scheme that inserts dummy packets in the real payload traffic and masks the dummy traffic sequence through the dynamic traffic pattern. It optimizes the dummy packet generation based on the packet drop experienced and minimized the dummy traffic to balance the routing security and overhead. It confirms the presence of malicious nodes based on the dummy packet dropping and relies on the trust mechanism to eliminate the misbehaving nodes in the critical path. The use of subjective and fuzzy trust model validates the accuracy of uncertain evidence and contextual factors in the trust. The effectiveness of the framework is realized by applying it on various routing protocols in wireless networks. The performance evaluation confirms excellent packet delivery of the proposed hybrid framework over various networks in a highly vulnerable environment.",11 May 2018,Wireless Personal Communications,"T.

The design of energy efficient WSN is still a greater research challenge. Clustering techniques have been widely used to reduce the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime. This paper introduces an algorithm named Fuzzy logic based Unequal clustering, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based Routing, Hybrid protocol for WSN to eliminate hot spot problem and extend the network lifetime. This protocol comprises of Cluster Head (CH) selection, inter-cluster routing and cluster maintenance. Fuzzy logic selects CHs efficiently and divides the network into unequal clusters based on residual energy, distance to Base Station (BS), distance to its neighbors, node degree and node centrality. It uses ACO based routing technique for efficient and reliable inter-cluster routing from CHs to BS. Moreover, this protocol transmits data in a hybrid manner, i.e. both proactive and reactive manner. A threshold concept is employed to transmit/intimate sudden changes in the environment in addition to periodic data transmission. For proper load balancing, a new routing strategy is also employed where threshold based data transmission takes place in shortest path and the periodic data transmission takes place in unused paths. Cross-layer cluster maintenance phase is also used for uniform load distribution. The proposed method is intensively experimented and compared with existing protocols namely LEACH, TEEN, DEEC and EAUCF.

Routing Algorithm for Energy Efficiency Optimizing of Wireless Sensor Networks based on Genetic Algorithms,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-023-10849-8,none,article,Springer,"Wirelles sensor network,Routing algorithm,Genetic algorithm,Energy balancing,Optimize energy efficiency","With the popularization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the concept of IoT (Internet-of-things), several applications have emerged in the industrial, scientific and engineering sectors. However, energy consumption is a challenge, because the demands for improvement in transmission rates and latency limitations. In particular, increasing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks has been a common goal in recent research. A viable alternative to solve this problem consists in reducing the data traffic defined by the routing protocol, which optimizes the number of messages that travel through the network. These protocols can also be optimized using evolutive algorithms, such as genetic algorithms. In the present work, is proposed a routing algorithm for WSN based on genetic algorithms, with the purpose of minimizing the total distance from the sensor node to the sink, which would allow optimized use of energy by sensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the WSN. The proposed algorithm includes a form of chromosome coding that had not yet been used in the context of routing and a new multi-objective fitness function. Performance analyzes were carried out establishing exhaustive search (ES) and opportunistic routing (OR) algorithms as comparison references and considering two scenarios: an open field and the other in a closed residential area. Proposed algorithm revealed superior performance when compared to reference algorithms. In open space and in the residential scenario, the lifetime provided by the proposed algorithm was 7320 and transmissions greater than that provided by OR. It was also observed that, with the increase in the number of transmissions, the standard deviation of the nodes’ residual energy is smaller when GAEA-RP is applied, which means the predictability of the energy consumed by them. After \(1.8 \times 10^{5}\) transmissions, it was 0.105 J for GAEA-RP versus 0.188 J for OR in the first scenario. In the second scenario, in addition to the smaller standard deviation of the residual energy, the proposed algorithm provides an average energy very close to that obtained with OR, which indicates the possibility of its application in environments with more obstacles. Concisely, the work introduces a new way of performing routing in WSN with average residual energy similar to OR, but with a slightly larger lifespan and greater residual energy uniformity between nodes.",30 January 2024,Wireless Personal Communications,"Kaíque Rhuan de Azevedo Albuquerque,Rafael Pereira de Medeiros,Rafael Moura Duarte,Juan Moises Mauricio Villanueva,Euler Cássio Tavares de Macêdo","(Federal University of Paraíba,João Pessoa - Paraíba,Brazil)",Brazil

These sensor nodes (SNs) follow an ad-hoc configuration and are connected with the Base Station (BS) through the internet for data sharing. When more amounts of data are shared from several SNs, traffic arises within the network, and controlling and balancing the traffic loads (TLs) are significant. The TLs are the amount of data shared by the network in a given time. Balancing these loads will extend the network’s lifetime and reduce the energy consumption (EC) rate of SNs. Thus, the Load Balancing (LB) within the network is very efficient for the network’s energy optimization (EO). However, this EO is the major challenging part of WSN. Several existing research concentrated and worked on energy-efficient LB optimization to prolong the lifetime of the WSN. Therefore, this review collectively presents a detailed survey of the linear programming (LP)-based optimization models and alternative optimization models for energy-efficient LB in WSN. LP is a technique used to maximize or minimize the linear function, which is subjected to linear constraints. The LP methods are utilized for modeling the features, deploying, and locating the sensors in WSN.

Indeed, the behavior of such networks becomes very unstable in node’s heterogeneity and/or node’s failure. In WSNs, clusters are dynamically built up by neighbor nodes, to save energy and prolong the network lifetime. One of the nodes plays the role of Cluster Head (CH) that is responsible for transferring data among the neighboring sensors. Due to pervasive use of WSNs, finding an energy-efficient policy to opt CHs in the WSNs has become increasingly important. Due to this motivations, in this paper, a modified Stable Election Protocol (SEP), named Prolong-SEP (P-SEP) is presented to prolong the stable period of Fog-supported sensor networks by maintaining balanced energy consumption. P-SEP enables uniform nodes distribution, new CH selecting policy, and prolong the time interval of the system, especially before the failure of the first node. P-SEP considers two-level nodes’ heterogeneities: advanced and normal nodes. In P-SEP, the advanced and normal nodes have the opportunity to become CHs. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by varying the various parameters of the network in comparison with other state-of-the-art cluster-based routing protocols.

To achieve this goal, this study adopts the SI method, combines the characteristics of WSN, and proposes a WSN clustering algorithm by the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO). Firstly, by grouping network nodes to form clusters, the clusters’ optimal number is obtained with the minimum network energy, reducing the networks’ communication overhead. Secondly, the CPSO is used in each cluster to select the appropriate cluster head nodes to undertake data aggregation and transmission tasks. Meantime, these nodes are also responsible for maintaining and managing the energy consumption of the nodes within the cluster to extend the network’s lifetime. Finally, the energy of WSN's clustered nodes is rotated using global and local rotation methods to maintain the stability of WSN nodes. The research results reveal that compared with traditional WSN routing algorithms, the stable working time of the CPSO-based SI of the clustering routing algorithm can be extended by 30.10%. The lifecycle of WSN can be extended by 55.20%, significantly reducing energy consumption and improving data transmission efficiency.

Wireless sensor network (WSN) contains less power and lowest price sensor nodes (SNs). Each SN is located in particular area and wireless system process via self-organizing. Still, data communication among nodes in a potential way is impossible because of different complicated factors, namely wireless links, limited energy, battery operation, and so on. Clustering is a famous method for creating data transmission more efficient. The clustering technique divided SNs into different groups. Each cluster in network takes exclusive cluster head (CH) nodes that send data to other SNs in cluster. In recent times, some considerations like high reliability and less energy consumption are essential to choosing the optimum CH nodes in clustering-related metaheuristic mechanisms. The selection of proper CHs using metaheuristic algorithms finds useful in design of energy-efficient WSNs. Therefore, this study presents a new Green Anaconda Optimization Based Energy Aware Clustering Protocol (GAOB-EACP) approach for WSN. The projected GAOB-EACP approach mainly inherits characteristics of green anaconda (GA) to choose CHs. The GAOB-EACP technique improves load balancing among nodes from the network to extend the lifetime and reduce energy utilization. In addition, an objective function is designed to accomplish Quality of Service (QoS) in WSN using three input parameters, namely energy, distance, and delay. The GAOB-EACP technique assured efficient clustering of the nodes, leading to high stability, minimal energy utilization, and maximum lifetime. To exhibit superior performance of GAOB-EACP method, an extensive range of simulations can be implemented.

To reduce the energy consumption from the direct transmission, clustering and routing techniques are used. In this paper, we propose clustering and routing algorithms called energy-efficient two-phase approach using fuzzy logic (EETPF). Here, the rule-based fuzzy logic is used to associate the input values of clustering and routing algorithm. The fuzzy system makes decisions according to the residual energy of sensor nodes, distance of sensor nodes from the BS and the number of nodes in the communication range. The crisp values of the input variables are converted into different fuzzy values. The fuzzy output values are converted to crisp values using centroid defuzzification method. The cluster heads (CHs) and routers are selected with respect to the output values. The sensor nodes get allocated to respective CHs according to the load handling capacity of CHs.

The work takes up two techniques for improving the lifetime of the linear iterative regression based clustered network. As the energy of the cluster head drains below a threshold due to the traffic carried, the cluster member of the dead heading node can be allocated to some existing eligible cluster heads in the network so that the data sensed by these nodes can still be communicated to the sink. Alternately the allocation of secondary cluster head can be done for the aggregation of data which serves for improvement in lifetime of the network.

Clusters are made up some sensors with one node as cluster head among them that is responsible for aggregation and transmission of information. Cluster heads that are placed near to base station have much workload which results in continuous energy drainage at cluster head. Due to this, all nearby cluster heads become dead early. If selection of node as a cluster head and its relocation is based on the residual energy of nodes, then it results in to prolong the lifetime of cluster heads.

When the number of CHs are greater than threshold limit, then few of the CHs work as GHs and they are selected by using the proposed fitness function that depends on residual energy, Euclidean distances, and location of the grid-centroid of CHs.

To provide a secure communication, encryption techniques based on some keys need to be used, and the participating sensor nodes should agree with it. The sensor nodes are resource constrained in terms of energy, memory, and processing power. As a result, the key agreement technique in WSN is nontrivial. Therefore, many key agreement techniques have been developed, however most of them focus primarily on security, which is not considered a relevant concern in the context of energy efficiency. There is a compromise between energy usage and security, so we've proposed an algorithm to address it. Also, the nodes in WSN can be benefited by using symmetric based pairwise key establishment for efficient communication in the network. The proposed algorithm strikes a crucial balance between secure routing and energy consumption within wireless sensor networks, outperforming well-established routing algorithms by delivering optimal results. In this paper, we have proposed a Secure and Energy Efficient Protocol Based on Pairwise Key (SEE2PK) for WSN. In the proposed scheme, nodes need to store only one row of the secure matrix and establish secure communication after exchanging one column of a public matrix, which is based on the neighbor adjacency matrix of a cluster. This scheme benefits from using a mesh router as a Cluster Head (CH) due to more memory and computation power.

An adversary can physically capture WSN deployed in a hostile environment. Once an adversary captures a node, the cryptographic information and the software program can be easily extracted. Also, the adversary can reprogram the software inside the node. After reprogramming, the adversary can replicate and deploy the node with multiple identities to do malicious activities. This kind of identity theft attack can be classified as Clone attack or Sybil attack. These identity theft attacks are addressed by many distributed, centralised and localised solutions. Most of these solutions utilise private/public key, and symmetric key algorithms are energy and memory demanding, while the WSN are energy and memory constrained. This paper proposes a novel Sybil attack detection protocol (NoSad) to identify and isolate the Sybil attack in WSN. This protocol is a localised method using intra-cluster communication and RSSI value to identify the Sybil node. The proposed protocol is simulated extensively with various topologies, and obtained results prove that the protocol is highly efficient in detection ratio, energy utilisation, memory usage, computation and communication requirement. This protocol may be used in any resource-constrained WSN to obtain a satisfactory result.

To function in inaccessible and hostile areas, without human intervention makes conservation of energy extremely important. The lifetime of the sensor network can be expanded with the help of energy-reaping sources. WSN has battery-operated sensor nodes and as the day over the battery starts losing its charging hence causing a reduction in the lifetime of the sensor nodes and hence the sensor network. For this reason, here we used energy harvesting techniques to power the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose an Advanced wind-based Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (A-wLEACH) and an Improved-wind-based Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (IW-LEACH) utilizing real-time meteorological wind speed information from the weather forecast site. By utilizing a suitable commercial wind turbine, the hourly wind speed is converted into electrical energy which is then utilized to power a few of the sensor nodes. In the first scenario convex hull plot is used for the deployment of sensor nodes where the selection of cluster heads is fixed and wind-powered nodes only become cluster heads in all rounds. In the second scenario, the deployment of sensor nodes is random and some of the sensor nodes will be powered by wind energy and these nodes will become cluster heads. This proposed technique improves the lifetime of the sensor network, the energy consumption per transmission, battery consumption and throughput as compared to wLEACH.

The wireless routing protocols assume that the nodes are cooperating and well-behaving. However, such networks are subject to several active routing attacks such as dropping, flooding, and modification. The primary intention of such attack is to thwart the objectives of routing protocols and cause network malfunction. This state of affairs motivates the recent research towards the development of a sophisticated security framework that works well against active routing attacks. This paper proposes GUARD, an intrusion detection framework that aims at detecting the active routing attacks efficiently with a considerable reduction in energy consumption. The GUARD incorporates three mechanisms such as a Restricted Directional Watchdog Selection, a Game Design, and an Incentive Estimation. Applying the Restricted Directional Watchdog Selection makes the GUARD a lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS) model, where only a limited number of nodes turn on IDS. The GUARD utilizes non-cooperative game design and exploits the advantage of Fuzzy q-learning to determine the malicious activity. The notion of Fuzzy q-learning determines the results of the player strategies of game design to measure the appropriate reward. The GUARD framework is incorporated into the popular protocols such as AODV and LEACH to validate the effectiveness of the defense mechanism.

High energy consumption of these networks, as a drawback, can be reduced by a hierarchical routing algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Quadrant Cluster based LEACH (Q-LEACH) protocols. To reduce energy consumption and provide a more appropriate coverage, the network was divided into several regions and clusters were formed within each region. In selecting the cluster head (CH) in each round, the amount of residual energy and the distance from the center of each node were calculated by the base station (including the location and residual energy of each node) for all living nodes in each region. In this regard, the node with the largest value had the highest priority to be selected as the CH in each network region. The base station calculates the CH due to the lack of energy constraints and is also responsible for informing it throughout the network, which reduces the load consumption and tasks of nodes in the network. The information transfer steps in this protocol are similar to the LEACH protocol stages.

In WSNs, energy management and network lifetime optimization are major issues in the designing of cluster-based routing protocols. Clustering is an efficient data gathering technique that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, cluster heads (CHs) bear additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Improper selection of CHs causes increased energy consumption and also degrades the performance of WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution. Spider monkey optimization (SMO) is a relatively new nature inspired evolutionary algorithm based on the foraging behaviour of spider monkeys. It has proved its worth for benchmark functions optimization and antenna design problems.

In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is utilized to form the cluster, and a Fuzzy based Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (E-FEERP) is proposed using average distance of SN from BS, node density, energy and communication quality to transmit data from cluster head to the BS in an optimal manner. The proposed protocol used parallel fitness function computing to quickly converge to the best possible solution with fewer iterations. The protocol used PSO-based clustering algorithm that recognize how birds act when they are in a flock. It is an optimization strategy that uses parallel fitness function computing to get to an optimal solution quickly and with a small number of iterations. Fuzzy is combined with PSO to increase coverage with reduced computational overhead. The proposed E-FEERP improves network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, Residual Energy (RE), throughput, energy consumption, load balancing ratio, and network lifetime.

However, the nature of sensor nodes, i.e., limited battery life and inefficient protocols, greatly reduces the sensor networks’ lifetime. Therefore, determining how to extend their lifetime has become an important issue for WSNs. This paper focuses on the technique of extending the networks’ lifetime by reducing and balancing energy consumption and proposes an enhanced energy optimization routing protocol (EEORP) for WSNs. EEORP proposes a grid-based cluster head (CH) election algorithm and introduces the energy weight and declaration number order weight factors to reduce the energy consumption in the rotation of CHs. EEORP adopts the dynamic clustering algorithm to reduce the energy consumption in intra-cluster data collection. The hop-count gradient field and grid distance are also introduced in EEORP to minimize the energy consumption in inter-cluster forwarding of the data.

So the energy consumption is one of the most significant issues in WSNs that needs to be addressed. The role of routing protocols to select the best path to transmit data has an obvious effect on saving energy. This paper proposed an enhance energy conservation based on residual energy and distance (EECRED) routing protocol which is an improvement on the LEACH protocol. The main objective of the EECRED proposed protocol is to reduce energy dissipated, reduce the process of exchanging control packets between cluster members and cluster head, delay the death of nodes that acts as routers, load balancing between nodes in the network, and prolong the network lifetime. The base idea of the EECRED is to elect the proper node as cluster head based on nodes’ residual energy and take the distance into account when selecting the path of a packet through using the multi-hop technique. The performance of EECRED protocol specified through compares the simulation results with LEACH, LEACH-C, PC-LEACH, and EMRCR protocols in terms of a number of alive nodes, energy consumption, and the network lifetime. The results show that the improvement rate of the EECRED proposed protocol is 50%, 39.76%, 50%, and 83.64% compared with LEACH, LEACH-C, PC-LEACH, and EMRCR protocols respectively in terms of the number of nodes stay alive.

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a specialized network of minimum cost, and power sensor nodes that can be described as the ability of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with each other. Query ordering with data aggregation is the process of scheduling of the nodes to receive the useful data from sensors. Data aggregation is considered as one of the fundamental processing procedures for saving the energy. In WSN data aggregation is an effective way to save the limited resources. This paper proposes a novel query-based data aggregation model with the aid of intelligent techniques. The framing of the query order takes place and the frames are ranked on the basis of a multi-objective function. The newly developed multi-objective function includes Latency, Throughput, and Data freshness. Initially, the solution corresponding to query order is trained in NN using the proposed Fitness-Mated Lion Algorithm (FM-LA). The optimally generated query order from NN is further given for second-level solution generation, which is again applied to FM-LA for subsequent query order optimization. Hence the two-stage optimization process with NN for query ordering is compared over the conventional methods in terms of performance measures like Latency, throughput, and data freshness.

To minimize network congestion by achieving fast convergence, this optimization algorithm incorporates the five objectives (congestion level, inflow rate, outflow rate, bandwidth, and queue length). To validate the performance of the proposed MFKHA algorithm, extensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB. Moreover, the proposed MFKHA algorithm is compared to those of cutting-edge meta-heuristic algorithms such as ECA-HA, ACSRO, and PSOGSA.

It has a range of application values. A network with a lot of good performance could meet more demands of practical applications. Therefore, topology control whose main goal is to prolong lifetime faces a new challenge. Although good link quality can’t improve some performance such as robustness and sparseness, it could decrease the probability of data retransmission. So if links have good quality, the energy is saved and the delay is reduced. But most existing topology control optimization algorithms ignore the importance of link quality. Hence, a bi-directional link communication quality evaluation indicator is designed firstly. Then, connectivity, link weight, interference among nodes, equilibrium of surplus energy, node degree, the transmitting power of nodes and node’s current surplus energy are integrated into utility function to structure a game model named MPOGM. Finally, on the basis of MPOGM, a topology control game algorithm of multi-performance cooperative optimization with self-maintaining (MPCOSM) is proposed.

Compressive sensing (CS), as scholars have recently considered, represents one of the most successful methods for lowering energy consumption in HWSNs.

A novel approach to collect data in sensor networks is presented in this paper. The end-user can configure devices to operate for a desired lifetime and achieve reliable operation for that duration—this is the motivation behind the development of this protocol. In the proposed protocol, data routing is controlled by a special packet—the Operator Packet. The Operator Packet circulates through the network (a) allowing nodes to report data when they need to and (b) is circulated such that it preferentially uses nodes with more data and with higher residual battery levels. Time complexity analysis of the the heuristic approach presented in this paper for the circulation algorithm takes O(n) time. The algorithm creates an opportunistic routing condition—the nodes operate only if their battery levels permit. This leads to controllable lifetime, with average lifetimes achieved by the nodes being as high as 99% of the preconfigured targets. If nodes in the network are configured with similar target lifetimes, a highly synchronised network death is possible. Compared to the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol and Hybrid Energy Efficient Distributed clustering protocol (HEED), the proposed protocol achieves higher lifetimes (60 and 165% respectively) and improved Coefficient of Synchronous Death (17 and 102% respectively).

There is a significant improvement in the network lifetime of approximately 36% and 65% compared to the existing Threshold-sensitive Stable Election Protocol (TSEP) and Cooperative low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (Coop-LEACH). Node cooperation increases reliability but at the cost of a decrease in the lifetime.

A chain-cluster based routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10845-010-0413-4,58,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor network,Chain based routing,Cluster based routing,Mobile and ubiquitous computing","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an emerging technology for monitoring physical world. Different from the traditional wireless networks and ad hoc networks, the energy constraint of WSNs makes energy saving become the most important goal of various routing algorithms. For this purpose, a cluster based routing algorithm LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) has been proposed to organize a sensor network into a set of clusters so that the energy consumption can be evenly distributed among all the sensor nodes. Periodical cluster head voting in LEACH, however, consumes non-negligible energy and other resources. While another chain-based algorithm PEGASIS (power- efficient gathering in sensor information systems) can reduce such energy consumption, it causes a longer delay for data transmission. In this paper, we propose a routing algorithm called CCM (Chain-Cluster based Mixed routing), which makes full use of the advantages of LEACH and PEGASIS, and provide improved performance. It divides a WSN into a few chains and runs in two stages. In the first stage, sensor nodes in each chain transmit data to their own chain head node in parallel, using an improved chain routing protocol. In the second stage, all chain head nodes group as a cluster in a self- organized manner, where they transmit fused data to a voted cluster head using the cluster based routing. Experimental results demonstrate that our CCM algorithm outperforms both LEACH and PEGASIS in terms of the product of consumed energy and delay, weighting the overall performance of both energy consumption and transmission delay.",14 May 2010,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"Feilong Tang,Minyi Guo,Yonggong Ma,Ilsun You,Feilong Tang,Song Guo","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,200240,China),(School of Information Science,Korean Bible University,Seoul,South Korea),(School of Computer Science and Engineering,The University of Aizu,Fukushima,965-8580,Japan)","China,Japan"

But, the main constraint faced by researchers is the energy available with sensor nodes. The network should have a longer lifetime to offer better data aggregation. So there is a need to prolong the life of sensor nodes and thus WSN. It is necessary to design energy-efficient operational schemes. One of the most suitable approaches to enhance energy efficiency is the clustering scheme, which enhances the performance parameters of WSN. Thus Adaptive Ranking based Energy-efficient Opportunistic routing (AREOR) is an opportunistic scheme that creates dynamic clusters and offers a longer lifetime to the network due to its heuristic. This scheme is modified based on the cooperation of nodes termed Cooperation Federated-AREOR (CF-AREOR), further enhancing the network’s performance parameters. This protocol is implemented using a network simulator, and its performance is analyzed based on the lifetime of the network based on factors like the number of alive nodes with respect to time, the first node dies time (FND), the last node dies time (LND), network lifetime, and even remaining energy in nodes. This protocol shows improved FND time, alive nodes, and longer network lifetime than existing well-known LEACH, AODV, ACO, IACR, and EMCBR. A performance increase in FND is 52% as compared to LEACH, and LND time is up to 84% increase.

Prolonging the time interval before the death of the first sensor node, viz. the stability period, is critical for many applications where the feedback from the WSN must be reliable. Although Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-like protocols are fundamental and popular clustering protocols to manage the system’s energy and thus to prolong the lifespan of the network, they assume a near to a perfect energy homogeneous system where a node failure, drainage and re-energizing are typically not considered. More recent protocols like Stable Election Protocol (SEP) considers the reverse, i.e., energy heterogeneity, and properly utilizes the extra energy to guarantee a stable and reliable performance of the network system. While paradigms of computational intelligence such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years to address various WSN’s challenges such as nodes deployment and localization, data fusion and aggregation, security and routing, they did not (to the best of our knowledge) explore the possibility of maintaining heterogeneous-aware energy consumption to guarantee a reliable and robust routing protocol design. By this, a new protocol named stable-aware evolutionary routing protocol (SAERP), is proposed in this paper to ensure maximum stability and minimum instability periods for both homogeneous/heterogeneous WSNs. SAERP introduces an evolutionary modeling, where the cluster head election probability becomes more efficient, to well maintain balanced energy consumption in both energy homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.

In WSNs, energy management and network lifetime optimization are major issues in the designing of routing protocols. Clustering is an efficient data gathering technique that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, cluster heads (CHs) bear additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Improper selection of CHs causes increased energy consumption and also degrades the performance of WSN. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for the long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution.

It is possible to reduce network energy usage and network lifespan prolongation by proper balancing of the network load with Cluster Head (CH) election. The single-hop inter-cluster routing technique, in which there is a direct transfer from CHs to the base station, is done by the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy.

The key idea of DRESEP is moving gathered information from sensor nodes to cluster head (CH) depending upon perceived changes. Dual-hop communication between CHs and base station is introduced to achieve energy minimization.

Energy resources of WSN nodes are generally restricted, irreplaceable and non-rechargeable. Hence, lowering the level of energy consumption in such networks to save more energy is the key issue in the literature. Clustering, selecting the best Cluster Head (CH) among candidates, and performing the routing only among cluster heads would be an effective approach to reduce the WSN nodes energy consumption. Therefore, cluster-based routing leads to extending the network’s lifetime through aggregating data in CHs, uniformly distributing the energy among nodes, and, consequently, reducing the number of contributing nodes in the routing procedure. In this paper, an energy-aware cluster-based multi-hop routing algorithm is presented, in which the clusters would, if required, re-formed during the routing procedure. Furthermore, like other multi-hop routing algorithms, it guarantees minimizing the energy consumption through balancing energy within the network. In this paper, we have presented a cluster-based multi-hop routing algorithm. In our proposed approach, a combination of two algorithms, namely K-means and Open Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA), are employed for clustering, and Genetic Algorithm, is applied for multi-hop routing.

This issue is critically important, especially when sensors are deployed to areas where it is practically impossible to charge their batteries, which are their only sources of power. Besides the development and deployment of ultra low-power devices, one effective computational approach is to partition the collection of sensors into several disjoint covers, so that each cover includes all targets, and then, activate the sensors of each cover one at a time.. This maximizes the possible disjoint covers with an available number of sensors and can be treated as a set-K cover problem, which has been proven to be NP-complete. Evolutionary programming is a very powerful algorithm that uses mutation as the primary operator for evolution. Hence, mutation defines the quality and time consumed in the final solution computation. We have applied the self adaptive mutation strategy based on hybridization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to develop to develop a faster and better solution. One of the limitations associated with the evolutionary process is that it requires definition of the redundancy covers, and therefore, it is difficult to obtain the upper bound of a cover. To solve this problem, a redundancy removal operator that forces the evolution process to find a solution without redundancy is introduced. Through simulations, it is shown that the proposed method maximizes the lifespan of WSNs.

IoT WSN plays a vital role in monitoring, collecting, and reporting the sensed data in the surrounding context. Anytime anywhere, data availability in IoT WSNs brings high packetized data volume and complex data routing process in exchanging information from the sensor node to cluster head and sink. In achieving QoS in a sensor network, data aggregation and dynamic traffic routing play an important role and, hence, impose challenges in itself. The wireless sensor nodes in IoT have limited processing capability and scarcity of power; hence, it becomes thought-provoking to select and use efficient protocol for data aggregation and dynamic routing. Largely, energy efficiency and less delay govern the QoS performance of the IoT WSN. This research paper proposes a novel and effective hybrid data aggregation and routing protocol at the network layer to bring out efficacy in end-to-end delay and energy efficiency by modifying the delay- and energy-efficient data collection (DEEDC) and the reactive anchor-based routing protocol. The proposed approach of mixed time slot scheduling strategy for data aggregation and anchor-based dynamic data traffic routing gives efficacy to construct energy- and delay-efficient, collision-free time slot schedule scheme for data aggregation and routing with constrained flooding and dynamic clustering. The research work considers WSN deployed to monitor spatio-temporal events with a mobile sink. This holistic approach resulted in reduced energy consumption and delay, and a higher number of data packets processed by the sink successfully. The applicable mathematical modeling and substantiated simulation results have been carried out using Network Simulator 2 (NS2), an open-source event-driven simulator for WSNs. The following QoS performance metrics: throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, routing overhead, energy consumption have been compared by varying number of sensor nodes, input data rate, and node mobility. Then, the proposed hybrid protocol has been applied on modified low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (MLEACH) and modified power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (MPEGASIS). Also, the obtained results have been compared with low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS), improved stable election protocol (ISEP), and fuzzy logic-based effective clustering (FLEC) protocols.

Nowadays, the application of the IoT sensor nodes in various domains of endeavors such as health-care, smart homes, industrial and production sectors, control networks, and in many other fields has continued to increase steadily. In IoT-based WSN, sensor nodes dynamically join the internet and collaborate to accomplish a mission by sensing and collecting event data from the application field. The sensor nodes thus forward the collected information to the sink nodes or to the nearest base station for further transmission. However, one of the significant drawbacks of the IoT-based WSN networks is that the battery life of the sensor nodes is often short-lived due to the energy-limited nature of the electronic sensors, resulting in the network’s short lifetime. Thus, prolonging the lifetime duration of the sensor nodes becomes a fundamental task. Whether the battery life of a sensor node is extended for a reasonable length of time or depleted in a moment depends mainly on the energy efficiency of the underlying routing protocol. Therefore, the issue of network lifetime can be fundamentally addressed by implementing an efficient and robust energy-aware routing protocol for sustainable and prolonged network operation time in a WSN based IoT network scenario. In this paper, a cluster-based Backpressure routing (CBPR) scheme has been proposed, which targets to prolong the network lifetime and enhance the data transmission reliability using energy load-balancing mechanism. For every cluster of the sensor node, the CBPR scheme elects a cluster head which has the highest energy level and the shortest distance to the sink node. The proposed CBPR routing scheme further utilizes a very robust data aggregation algorithm to checkmate and prevent the circulation of redundant data packets in the network while also exploiting the Backpressure scheduling machine for data packets queueing and for route selection, which allows it to select the next-hop sensor node based on the queue length value of the sensor nodes. Extensive simulations have been performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed CBPR routing scheme, which was compared with that of other well-known routing schemes such as the Information Fusion Based Role Assignment and Data Routing for In-Network Aggregation in terms of throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio.",17 February 2021,Wireless Personal Communications,"R.

However, a notable drawback in these networks is the energy consumption, which can be mitigated through compression techniques. Additionally, the limited lifespan of sensor batteries remains a concern. Even when incorporating renewable energy sources, ensuring energy efficiency in WSNs is imperative. One prevailing issue is the disregard for spatial data correlation in existing data clustering methods within WSNs. Addressing these challenges necessitates effective modeling and the acquisition of event source locations in the proposed scheme. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient lifetime-aware cluster based routing (EELCR) for WSN. In EELCR technique, modified giant trevally optimization (MGTO) algorithm is introduced for efficient balanced clustering which minimizes energy consumption. An optimal squirrel search (OSS) algorithm is used to selects the best optimal node, named as cluster head (CH) for prolonging the lifetime in the sensor networks. Each CH nodes compress clustering data using optimal selective Huffman compression to achieve maximum compression ratio which overcomes inefficiency of area overhead problem in existing Huffman compression. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid deep learning technique which combines deep neural network (DNN) with Granular neural network (GNN) (named as DGNN) to find optimal way for data broadcast from CH to base station (BS). Finally, we assess the efficacy of the proposed EELCR approach through various simulation scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness concerning Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The outcomes reveal a notable enhancement in our coding scheme, with an average compression rate improvement of 9.346% when compared to state-of-the-art coding techniques.

To record a real time event, large number of sensor nodes (SNs) need to be arranged systematically, such that information collection is possible for longer span of time. But, the hurdle faced by WSN is the limited resources of SNs. Hence, there is high demand to design and implement an energy efficient scheme to prolong the operational lifetime of WSN. Clustering based routing is the most suitable approach to support for load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliable communication to prolong performance parameters of WSN. These performance parameters are achieved at the cost of reduced lifetime of cluster head (CH). To overcome such limitations in clustering based hierarchical approach, efficient CH selection algorithm, and optimized routing algorithm are essential to design efficient solution for larger scale networks.

To overcome this issue, a novel “Reliable Clustering with Optimized Scheduling and Routing for Wireless Sensor Network” is proposed to provide an energy efficient and reliable clustering in which a novel GridCosins chain Clustering has been utilized that clusters the sensor nodes based on the GridCosins distance and also forms distance tree topology based chaining of sensor nodes in the cluster thereby it reduces the transmission range between the sensor nodes and increases network lifetime. To acquire data from the network's unclustered nodes, proper CH selection must be carried out. For this instance, a novel Turtle Search Algorithm- Desert Cat Swarm Optimization (TSA-DCSO) double CH selection is introduced in which the hybrid optimization improves the CH selection process that eliminates the steady-state phase's passive listening and inactivity. Furthermore, the energy consumption of this proposed clustering is maintained by the Robust Node Switching State Algorithm that eliminates the overload of CH with less energy depletion and also mitigates the increased energy depletion of sensor nodes during the transmission of data to the CH. However, the unexpected failure of sensor nodes occurs in the current methodologies as a result of channel congestion and mutual interference during data transmission to the sink node. Hence, a novel Decisive Scheduling Optimized communication cost Routing is proposed in which the decision-making process is based on the energy level and the round trip delay time to remove damaged nodes.

An Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Maximizing Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks using Machine Learning,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11036-023-02109-7,14,article,Springer,"Sensor node,Cluster,Schedule,Energy conservation,Data slot","Wireless sensor nodes come with small-sized batteries that provide the energy required to do all kinds of activities. Unnecessary usage of the radio, especially during idle listening, drains a lot of energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The proposed model, Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm (EECA), prolongs the WSN lifetime by minimizing energy consumption in sensor nodes. In EECA, the target area is considered to be a collection of small regions. The proposed model uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to select one node in each region as the cluster head (CH). The sensor nodes with a predefined minimum energy level qualify for the CH selection process. ANN calculates the scores of these nodes based on four parameters – residual energy, number of events detected, distance to the base station, and number of neighbours. The sensor node with the highest score is selected as the CH in its region. A limit called maximum cluster size is also defined to avoid the formation of huge clusters. Only the sensor nodes located close to an event inform the CH about the event. This rule ensures that redundant data is not transmitted to CHs. In the proposed model, a CH checks the medium for a very short duration at the beginning of a slot for incoming transmissions. If the CH does not receive any signal within this duration, it turns its radio OFF. This rule minimizes idle listening in CHs. EECA is compared with some existing medium access control protocols to find out its efficiency. The experimental results show that EECA saves more energy in sensor nodes than in other models.
