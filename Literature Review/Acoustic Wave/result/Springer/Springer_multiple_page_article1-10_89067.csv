One of the major tasks of the sensor nodes is the collection of data and forwarding the gathered data to the base station (BS). Hence, the network lifetime becomes the major criteria for effective design of the data gathering schemes in WSN. In this paper, an energy-efficient LEACH (EE-LEACH) Protocol for data gathering is introduced. It offers an energy-efficient routing in WSN based on the effective data ensemble and optimal clustering. In this system, a cluster head is elected for each clusters to minimize the energy dissipation of the sensor nodes and to optimize the resource utilization. The energy-efficient routing can be obtained by nodes which have the maximum residual energy. Hence, the highest residual energy nodes are selected to forward the data to BS. It helps to provide better packet delivery ratio with lesser energy utilization. The experimental results shows that the proposed EE-LEACH yields better performance than the existing energy-balanced routing protocol (EBRP) and LEACH Protocol in terms of better packet delivery ratio, lesser end-to-end delay and energy consumption.

The consumption of energy during transmission and processing of data is more which makes the sensor network to erroneous state. In WSN, Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is a popular hierarchical routing protocol, which is responsible for energy storage in nodes. The residual energy and distance between the base station and node are not considered for selection of cluster head in traditional methods. This paper proposes a Cross Layer-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy model (CL-LEACH), an efficient routing protocol to increase the lifetime of the battery. CL-LEACH considers residual energy and for cluster head selection and provides an energy efficient transmission schemes for WSN. The cross-layer design delivers adaptive modulation by abusing intersegment dependencies across Medium Access Control, Physical, and Application layers. Moreover, CL-LEACH utilizes the remaining energy of the node for cluster head selection which preserves the overall energy. The proposed method provides better results in terms of number of live nodes, energy dissipation, message cost when compared to the traditional LEACH protocol.

Impact of the energy-based and location-based LEACH secondary cluster aggregation on WSN lifetime,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-016-1414-9,34,article,Springer,"Energy-efficient,Network lifetime,FLEACH,Wireless sensor networks,Energy aware protocols,Classification of protocols,Survey","The improvement of sensor networks’ lifetime has been a major research challenge in recent years. This is because sensor nodes are battery powered and may be difficult to replace when deployed. Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchical (LEACH) routing protocol was proposed to prolong sensor nodes lifetime by dividing the network into clusters. In each cluster, a cluster head (CH) node receives and aggregates data from other nodes. However, CH nodes in LEACH are randomly elected which leads to a rapid loss of network energy. This energy loss occurs when the CH has a low energy level or when it is far from the BS. LEACH with two level cluster head (LEACH-TLCH) protocol deploys a secondary cluster head (2CH) to relieve the cluster head burden in these circumstances. However, in LEACH-TLCH the optimal distance of CH to base station (BS), and the choicest CH energy level for the 2CH to be deployed for achieving an optimal network lifetime was not considered. After a survey of related literature, we improved on LEACH-TLCH by investigating the conditions set to deploy the 2CH for an optimal network lifetime. Experiments were conducted to indicate how the 2CH impacts on the network at different CH energy levels and (or) CH distance to BS. This, is referred to as factor-based LEACH (FLEACH). Investigations in FLEACH show that as CHs gets farther from the BS, the use of a 2CH extends the network lifetime. Similarly, an increased lifetime also results as the CH energy decreases when the 2CH is deployed. We further propose FLEACH-E which uses a deterministic CH selection with the deployment of 2CH from the outset of network operation. Results show an improved performance over existing state-of-the-art homogeneous routing protocols.",23 November 2016,Wireless Networks,"Oluwatosin Ahmed Amodu,Raja Azlina Raja Mahmood","(Department of Communication Technology and Network,Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology,Universiti Putra Malaysia,43400 UPM,Serdang,Selangor Darul Ehsan,Malaysia)",Malaysia

The cluster heads (CHs) present in the clustered WSNs represent the key nodes. Since they accomplish several tasks, more energy is being consumed. Hence, it remains a significant conflict for choosing the optimal CHs. Most of the WSN routing protocol's labels particular conflicts with the “Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy” (LEACH) protocol. The challenge for the WSN protocols is to maintain high scalability and expand the lifespan of the network. The major challenge in enhancing the WSNs is energy efficiency. Since communication occupies many portions of the energy consumption, and efficient solution to handle this problem is effective routing. The main intention of this paper is to develop the energy-efficient routing for WSN using a hybrid meta-heuristic-based LEACH protocol. Here, the optimal CH selection is accomplished by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm with Sail Fish Optimization (SFO) and Jaya Algorithm (JA), and the so formed algorithm is called Limit-based Jaya Sail Fish Optimization (L-JSFO). A Multi-objective function is considered with significant constraints like “energy, distance, delay, trusts of nodes, load, and Quality of Service (QoS)”.

Recent researchers show that incorporating Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) into ITS can decrease the necessary investment and permits the creation of intelligent collaborative applications that enhance traffic efficiency and driver safety. In this paper, we propose a Trust Aware Clustering Technique based on Rat Swarm Optimizer for WSN-based Intelligent Transportation System (TACTIRSO), which is a secure method for selecting cluster heads (CHs) based on nodes’ trust value. We employed the Rat Swarm Optimizer (RSO), one of the most recent swarm-based optimization methods, to efficiently choose CHs. For the selection of CH, the proposed fitness function takes into account the node remaining energy and trust value. Moreover, the exponential moving average model is employed to dynamically change the predefined threshold values according to the network state. In order to enhance the performance of RSO, we applied different local search strategies in addition to an energy and trust-aware method of initializing the rat population. The simulation results reveal that TACTIRSO outperforms existing studies in terms of energy efficiency, selection of most trustworthy nodes, and average network lifetime. Numerical results indicate that TACTIRSO improves average network stability by at least 1.13 times, average trust value by at least 3.31 times, and reliability by at least 4.45 times over other schemes in a heterogeneous network, while these improvements are by 1.02 times, 0.33 times, and 3.52 times, respectively, in a homogeneous network.",28 October 2022,The Journal of Supercomputing,"Walid Osamy,Walid Osamy,Ahmed M.

WSNs are often employed for detecting and tracking a wide range of entities involved in realistic scenarios where security is of vital importance. While selecting energy-efficient Cluster Heads (CHs) is the primary focus of the majority of clustering approaches currently in use in WSNs, researchers have not given adequate consideration to the security aspects of CHs when developing a CH selection strategy. Estimating the trust between the nodes not only makes the WSN secure, but also improves communication between nodes and makes the WSN more reliable.

SEACDSC incorporates a novel mechanism for determining secure and energy-efficient CHs among the WSN nodes. In particular, we propose a Discrete SCSO method, a variant of the traditional SCSO, to facilitate the secure and efficacious selection of CHs.

The sensor nodes are an important component of WSN-assisted IoT network running on limited and non-rechargeable energy resource. The performance of WSN-assisted IoT is decreased, when network is deployed at large area. So, developing robust and energy-efficient routing protocol is a challenging task to prolong the network lifetime. In contrast to the state-of-the-art techniques this paper introduces Scalable and energy efficient routing protocol (SEEP). SEEP leverages the multi-hop hierarchical routing scheme to minimize the energy consumption. To achieve scalable and energy efficient network, SEEP employs a multi-tier based clustering framework. The network area in SEEP is divided into various zones with the help of proposed subarea division algorithm. The number of zones in the network are increased as the network size increases to avoid long-distance communication. Every zone is divided into certain number of clusters (sub-zones) and the number of clusters are increased towards the base station, whereas the zone width is decreased.

Various energy efficient works are conducted without addressing the secured data transmission process. It is very challenging task to transfer data efficiently and securely to the desired location. Various researches has been done in this field but there are few limitations like malicious nodes are not considered and very complex systems are used for authentication like encryption and key management. In this paper a secure energy efficient algorithm using improved LEACH in optimization with Fire Fly algorithm (FFA) and Artificial neural network (ANN) to overcome all above said issues has been proposed. Cluster head selection is done using a new threshold value taking into account residual energy, average energy and covering distance of the nodes as compared to existing LEACH which uses only a probability based random number for CH selection. Due to the presence of malicious nodes in the route network performance degrades and data drop rate increases so there is need of energy efficient along with secure routing protocol. To fulfil this requirement firefly algorithm is used to get optimized node properties as output then this data is passed to ANN to provide communicating and non-communicating nodes as a result and attacker node in the existing route.

 Clustering is a way of grouping sensor nodes into clusters with CH responsible to receive from its members and send to base station BS, CH selection in efficient way prolongs network life time and stability region.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an essential role in supporting the IoT. These networks, made up of nodes with the ability to monitor their environment, enable the collection and transmission of specific data in real time, offering enhanced applications and services within IoT networks. This symbiosis between WSN and IoT can be defined as WSN-based IoT. The complexity of WSN-based IoT lies in the effective management of these varied devices, each with its own distinct capabilities. Clustering is a popular technique for reducing the communication load, conserving energy, aggregating data and optimizing the performance of WSN-based IoT systems. Once the cluster heads (CHs) are chosen, conventional clustering algorithms typically use a single radius of clustering (RC) to group devices into multiple clusters. However, this approach may not be optimized for WSN-based IoT networks, as devices may have different features, for example, the residual energy (\(R_{\rm Enrg}\)) and the distance to the base station (DistBS). In a previous work, we proposed the DCOPA (a distributed clustering based on objects performances aggregation for hierarchical communications in IoT applications) protocol for clustering in WSN-based IoT networks. DCOPA applies the same clustering algorithm to the elected CHs, without considering their distinctions in terms of \(R_{\rm Enrg}\) and DistBS. The proposed new approach, called unequal-DCOPA (UDCOPA), allows us to define for each CH its adaptive radius of clustering (ARC) which will be sensitive to the local criteria of \(R_{\rm Enrg}\) and DistBS of the CH concerned. The ARC is modeled as a multicriteria system applied to each CH. Simulation results show that our new UDCOPA approach outperforms DCOPA and LEACH protocols for energy management, load balancing, scalability and network lifetime.

Due to the limited energy of sensor nodes and the inability sensors recharge, many clustering-based methods have been offered to transmit the received information to the base station by sensors.

Based on these distances and Steiner tree structure, there exist two types of clustering. In this research, we present a function to evaluate the quality of cluster by means of which the quality of clusters in the two presented states can be examined and the best type of clustering can be selected.

However, WSN encounters limitations related to energy and sensor node lifespan, making the development of an efficient routing protocol a critical concern. Cluster technology offers a promising solution to this challenge. This study introduces a novel cluster routing protocol for WSN. The system selects cluster heads and relay nodes utilizing the multi-strategy fusion snake optimizer (MSSO) and employs the minimum spanning tree algorithm for inter-cluster routing planning, thereby extending the system’s lifecycle and conserving network energy. In pursuit of an optimal clustering scheme, the paper also introduces tactics involving dynamic parameter updating, adaptive alpha mutation, and bi-directional search optimization within MSSO. These techniques significantly increase the algorithm convergence speed and expand the available search space. Furthermore, a novel efficient clustering routing model for WSN is presented. The model generates different objective functions for selecting cluster heads and relay nodes, considering factors such as location, energy, base station distance, intra-cluster compactness, inter-cluster separation, and other relevant criteria. When selecting cluster heads, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is integrated into MSSO to improve the optimization performance of the algorithm. When planning inter-cluster routing, the next hop node is selected for the relay node based on distance, residual energy, and direction.The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol reduces energy consumption by at least 26.64% compared to other cluster routing protocols including LEACH, ESO, EEWC, GWO, and EECHS-ISSADE.

The contributions of the proposed protocols are (1) two level cluster head election strategy. In the first stage harmony search algorithm is used to determine initial set of energy efficient cluster head nodes that are sufficiently separated from on another by certain optimal distance.

For WSN, to attain the efficiency the optimal QoS parameters the efficient hybrid clustering approach and TDMA schedule based new routing protocol Q-LEACH has been proposed. For homogeneous and heterogeneous network of WSN the fitness function has been calculated. Hence the optimal cluster head CH has been selected from the fitness function leads to minimal energy and balancing of load. As per TDMA frame redesign every cluster node has its turn for data transmission in allocated slot. Hence all nodes equally send’s the data as per allocated slot and hence same amount of energy also used. Hence energy efficiency leads to long network life time. The proposed work of efficient hybrid clustering approach has been analysed in terms of QoS parameters such as energy efficiency, network lifetime, throughput and other parameters. The results of the proposed study evaluated with other existing approaches and comparative analysis have been performed.

Sensor nodes in WSN are deployed in fields with limited power. By nature these nodes are left unattended after deployment. This raises the importance of developing efficient algorithms which are capable of increasing the network lifetime by consuming less energy during the operations. This paper proposes a hybrid clustering energy aware routing protocol (H-CERP) for heterogeneous WSNs. H-CERP is designed to form efficient clusters with less cluster head count than the optimal estimation and uses multihop communication with gateway nodes to communicate with the base station. This novel approach makes our system more advantageous where the network lifetime and coverage of sensors are much vital at no additional cost.

The creation of clustering-based routing protocols was applied to the optimization of overall network energy. But, traditional clustering methods were unable to produce improved node heterogeneity, and extended network lifetime. Distributed clustering-based routing protocols are specially designed for enhancing the EE of the networks. In addition, EE can be improved by enhancing the heterogeneity of the node distribution. This paper aims to design the extended distributed clustering-based EE routing protocol. The heterogeneity of nodes is improved by introducing the additional intermediate advanced nodes layer in the network. Therefore, paper proposed to design the Multi-Level Heterogynous EDEEC rousing protocol called ML-HEDEEC by adapting optimum energy enhancing parameters. The notes are divided to normal, advance, advance-interdicted and supper nodes based on the energy allocated to them. The probability of nodes is modified for better clustering and cluster head election by introducing additional energy enhancement parameter. In addition, it is proposed to automatically adopt the network initial energy based on the scaling of network dimensions. This may lead to enhance EE of the network and may improve stability period. Finally, the results are evaluated for a case of WSN routing under the dynamic sink locations.

Energy-efficient routing protocols can improve the WSN performance, and the algorithms have been explored widely by the researchers. In the majority of the work, sensor nodes have been considered homogeneous in their configuration and capabilities. However, in practical scenarios and with the advent of an era of connected devices, called “Internet of Things,” consideration of node heterogeneity in WSN has become inevitable. Nodes’ heterogeneity can be exploited constructively in WSN routing algorithms. In the literature, many different heterogeneous WSN scenarios (e.g., energy, computation, link heterogeneities) have been considered and the routing algorithms have been proposed for performance improvement in such scenarios. This paper focuses on the routing concepts for diverse heterogeneous WSNs scenarios and covers the state of the art in the area. The clustering-based approaches for routing decisions are extensively covered under different heterogeneous WSN scenarios.

However, designing an energy efficient and durable WSN is still a key challenge. Though the contribution of the clustering mechanism attempts to augment the network LifeTime, the energy consumption in the Cluster Heads (CHs) is rapidly high. This led to the frequent change of CHs and minimized the network’s lifetime. To diminish these issues, we propose an Energy Efficient LifeTime Maximization (EELTM) approach which utilizes the intelligent techniques Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). Further, we propose an optimal CH–CR selection algorithm in our approach which exploits the fitness values calculated by the PSO technique to determine two optimal nodes in each cluster to act as CH and Cluster Router (CR). The selected CH exclusively gathers the information from its cluster members, whereas the CR is liable for receiving the gathered information from its CH and transferring it to the BS. Thus, the overhead of CH is reduced. Another intelligent technique is that FIS figures out the radius for each CH, and thereby it partitions the network into unequal clusters. The performance of our proposed EELTM approach is analyzed, and evaluations are elaborated with well-known existing clustering algorithms. To assess the proficiency of EELTM and to evaluate the endurance of the network, efficiency parameters such as total-remaining-energy, first-node-expires and fifty-percent-expires are exploited.

Sometimes, due to incomplete information of neighbor nodes, a proper cluster head is not selected and deplete energy quickly. This paper, presents a clustering protocol (NSMTSEP) based on neighbor support. Support of the neighbor node is used to calculate the threshold. Neighbor nodes are labeled based on dynamically changing parameters. The total energetic value of different nodes, cluster heads degree, the summative information of distances of member nodes, etc. is dynamically changing parameters. The label of a node is used to calculate the weight of that particular node. Weight is finally used to formulate equations for threshold calculation. The fundamental target is to increase the stable time, throughput, and network lifespan by reducing the cost incurred in intra-cluster communication. Neighbor supported labeled method is suitable for increasing longevity in the network. NSMTSEP upgrades stability by 8.6%, 36.9% as compared to enhanced threshold sensitive stable election protocol (ETSSEP) and threshold sensitive stable election protocol (TSEP). NSMTSEP is three times more stable than stable election protocol (SEP) and low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol (LEACH). Improvement in the lifespan of NSMTSEP is recorded by 11.98%, 3.43% and 24.9% over ETSSEP, TSEP, and LEACH respectively whereas more than twice in comparison with SEP.

Aiming at the problem of load balancing and lifetime prolonging for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and considering complex uncertainties existed in WSNs, this paper proposes a clustering routing protocol CRT2FLACO for WSN based on type-2 fuzzy logic and ant colony optimization (ACO). Specifically, in the cluster set-up phase, a type-2 Mamdnai fuzzy logic system (T2MFLS) is built to handle uncertainties better and balance the network load, in which three important factors—residual energy, the number of neighbor nodes and the distance to the base station (BS) of a node—are considered as inputs, and the probability of the node to be a candidate cluster head (CH) and the CH competition radius as outputs of our T2MFLS, to select the final CHs; in the steady-state phase, in order to reduce the transmission consumption, all the CHs are linked into a chain using ACO algorithm, then each CH send its data packet to the leader along link, which is a CH eventually transmitting packets to the BS. The simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol can effectively balance network load and reduce the transmission energy consumption of CHs, thus greatly prolong the lifetime of WSN.

Such networks and clustering of the nodes for energy efficiency go hand in hand. Clustering protocols like low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, stable election protocol, improved low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy etc. allow the nodes to grouped together, form clusters and transmit their information to the base station via their leader, i.e. cluster head. Selection of cluster head follows various approaches and vary from protocol to protocol. While some of the approaches use single hop communication of the cluster head with the base station, others opt for multi-hop communication. This paper describes energy effective procedure for heterogeneous network consisting of super, advance and normal nodes. The protocol operates according to the type of the nodes. For the high energy super nodes, the protocol follows centralized procedure and for other nodes it follows decentralized approach. The selection of cluster head among the super nodes is optimized by the use of cost function depending upon distance of the nodes from the centroid of their residual energies and their signal to interference plus noise ratio. The nodes other than super nodes achieve lesser energy consumption by using the mobile agents to transfer their data to the base station.

Data gathering and transmission to the base station are two of the main responsibilities of the sensor nodes (BS). As a result, the network lifespan becomes the key factor in the successful design of data collection strategies in WSN. In this study, we provide the Enriched energy optimized LEACH (EE-OLEACH) protocol for data transfer. Through a combination of efficient optimum clustering and an optimal route selection mechanism, it provides a means for energy-efficient routing in WSN. The Homogeneous Hunter-Wolf optimization (HHWO) is used for clustering, and a cluster head is chosen for each cluster to reduce energy loss among sensor nodes and maximize efficiency in their use of available resources. Nodes with the highest residual energy may receive the most energy-efficient routing. In order to send the data to BS, the nodes with the greatest residual energy are chosen. The pheromone-profound Ant optimization (PPAO) method was then used to reduce energy consumption throughout the path-selection process. It contributes to a higher packet delivery ratio while reducing power consumption. According to the experimental findings, the proposed EE-OLEACH performs better than the current Protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, and energy usage. In this paper, we compare the performance of the existing hierarchical routing protocols under varying conditions (packet size, starting energy level, etc.) and demonstrate how the optimal CH selection based on a suggested algorithm improves both network lifetime and energy consumption.

Since the wireless sensor devices are energy constrained, the issue of high energy consumption by the malicious nodes must be addressed well in order to enhance the network performance by making increased network lifetime, reduced energy consumption and delay. In the past, many researchers worked in the provision of new techniques for providing improved security to WSN in order to enhance the reliability in the routing process. However, most of the existing routing techniques are not able to achieve the required security through the use of intelligent techniques for safeguarding the sensor nodes from malicious attacks. In order to address these problems, a new fuzzy temporal clustering-based secured communication model with trust analysis and outlier detection has been developed in this research work. For this purpose, a new fuzzy temporal rule-based cluster-based routing algorithm with trust modelling and outlier detection for monitoring the nodes participating in the communication has been proposed. In addition, a fuzzy temporal rule- and distance-based outlier detection algorithm is also proposed in this paper for distinguishing the malicious nodes from other nodes within each cluster of the network and has been used in the secured routing algorithm. The proposed secure routing algorithm uses the temporal reasoning tasks of explanation-based learning and prediction as well as spatial constraints for making efficient routing decisions through the application of trust and key management techniques for performing effective authentication of nodes and thereby isolating the malicious nodes from communication through outlier detection. By applying these two proposed algorithms for communication in the proposed work, it is proved through experiments that the proposed secure routing algorithm and the outlier detection algorithm are able to perform secured and reliable routing through genuine cluster head nodes more effectively. Moreover, these two algorithms provide improved quality of service with respect to the reliability of communication, packet delivery ratio, reduction in end-to-end delay and reduced energy consumption.

At the outset, every sensor in the WSN starts to broadcast a beacon signals to share its identity, hop distance and residual energy with its neighbors. Subsequently, the sensor nodes store the received information in the form of a table and it is updated periodically with the corresponding cluster head. The working principle of the proposed method is categorized into three stages, they are the sensor nodes clustering, optimal path detection, and optimal gateway detection. In the sensor nodes clustering, a weighted Steiner tree is constructed for efficient clustering of the sensor nodes in the WSN.

Owing to the node density, the same data are collected by multiple sensors that introduce redundancy, which should be avoided by means of proper data aggregation methodology. With that note, this paper presents a cluster-based systematic data aggregation model (CSDAM) for real-time data processing. First, the network is formed into a cluster with active and sleep state nodes and cluster-head (CH) is selected based on ranking given to sensors with two criteria: existing energy level (EEL) and geographic-location (GL) to base station (BS), [i.e., Rank(EEL,GL)]. Here, the CH is the aggregator. Second, Aggregation is carried out in 3 levels where the data processing of level 3 has been reduced by aggregating the data at level 1 and level 2. If the energy of aggregator goes below the threshold, we choose another aggregator. Third, Real time application should be given more precedence than other applications, so additionally an application type field is added to each sensor node from which the priority of data processing is given first to real time applications. The simulation results show that CSDAM minimizes the consumption of energy and transmission delay effectively, thereby increasing the network lifespan.",13 January 2020,Wireless Personal Communications,"M.

Many researchers provide a quality contribution in this area. Still, there are many challenges related to residual energy, stability of routes, network lifetime, and local optima. According to the latest research Meta heuristic algorithms give better results as compared to the classical model for selecting optimal routes. In this work, a hybrid Meta heuristic approach is present that combines the features of whale optimization and lion optimization (WL-optimization). In the proposed approach multi-objective function is used for selecting the optimal CH and routes. This proposed WL-optimization replaces the exploitation phase of Whale optimization with a mutated Lion operator to prevent earlier trapping of solutions into local optima. It prevents delayed convergence and maintains the harmonious balance between exploitation and exploration which will reflect in the stability of routes.

The current selective forwarding attack detection schemes, randomly select checkpoint nodes, available in-between nodes within a forwarding route, which are responsible for producing acknowledgments for each received packet. In this paper, the complete sets of nodes are differentiated into three different types based on their functionality as Inspector Node (IN), Cluster Head (CH), and Member Nodes (MN). The newly considered node as IN is considered to overhear all of the activities of the Cluster head, as CH is the most compromising node in the complete cluster, and in the case, if the CH is attacked then the complete cluster stops working in the network.

This paper resolves this problem by designing a novel Secure Deep Learning (SecDL) approach for dynamic cluster-based WSN-IoT networks. To improve energy efficiency, the network is designed to be Bi-Concentric Hexagons along with Mobile Sink technology. Dynamic clusters are formed within Bi-Hex network and optimal cluster heads are selected by Quality Prediction Phenomenon (QP2) that ensure QoS and also energy efficiency. Data aggregation is enabled in each cluster and handled with a Two-way Data Elimination then Reduction scheme. A new One Time-PRESENT (OT-PRESENT) cryptography algorithm is designed to achieve high-level security for aggregated data.

MANET comprises arbitrary, battery-driven, roaming nodes that do not have architecture that can handle the traffic and control the IoT network.

Current opportunistic protocols need large messages for the restoration of the cluster that leads to more energy consumption and packet loss. To overcome these issues, this work proposes the reliable, energy-efficient opportunistic protocol known as Opportunistic Density Clustering Routing Protocol.

The primary objective is to collect and analyze the sensed data for deriving valuable information. Due to the limited memory, processing power, and battery capacity of sensors, all the data must be transmitted to the base station (BS) for further processing. Clustering is a commonly used method for data routing in WSNs. In this method, cluster heads (CHs) are responsible for aggregating the data within their clusters and transmitting it to the BS directly or through multi-hop transmission. However, the main challenges in this approach lie in achieving optimal CHs’ selection, efficient data routing, and load balancing. An unbalanced load among CHs can lead to hot-spot problem. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called the Multi-Objective Unequal Optimal Clustering Algorithm for WSN (MOUOC). This algorithm combines fuzzy logic with a linear mathematical model, considering four essential sensor parameters: residual energy, average distance of nearby nodes, the standard deviation of the distance of nearby nodes, and the distance to the BS. MOUOC selects optimal CHs with appropriate cluster size and load balancing. It solves the hot-spot problem and operates in a distributed manner, enabling high scalability.

Simulation outcomes showed that this proposed EHMoWP outperforms significantly the conventional techniques concerning residual energy and the number of alive and dead nodes. The proposed EHMoWP exhibits almost 10% higher residual energy with improved network lifetime which is measured in terms of alive node and dead node count. Based on the analysis of dead node and alive node estimation, it was observed that the number of alive nodes was 10% higher and the number of dead nodes was 10% fewer than in the conventional technique.

This paper presents the cross layer mechanism for the management of congestion using Fuzzy based Cross layer mechanism using Oppostional Artificial Bee Colony (FCOABC) protocol. The proposed protocol integrates the notion of media accessibility and energy proficient hierarchical based cluster routing for increasing the network lifespan and energy efficiency. This proposed cross layer protocol uses fuzzy logic by means of considering the fuzzy descriptors such as, communication link reliability, number of neighboring nodes and precipitant (residual energy) for CH selection. Then, the network is organized into non-similar sized clusters (i.e. the clusters that are much closer to the MS holding smaller sizes and the clusters that are far away from the MS having larger sizes) for addressing the hot spots problem in WSN. The smaller sized cluster are considered because, the CHs of the smaller sized clusters are largely closer to the master station; thus, they experienced only small amount of intra-cluster congestion and forwards the relay traffic effectively using their preserved energy. Finally, the proposed FCOABC protocol employed the Oppositional Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm for performing inter cluster multi-hop routing from CHs to master station; therefore, an energy efficient and reliable data transfer is achieved to the master station. The operation of FCOABC protocol is primarily divided into three stages namely, Network-Association stage, nearest node detection stage and consistent-state stage. The results of conventional clustering protocols such as, ULCA, UCR, IFUC, and EAUCF is used for comparing the performance of proposed FCOABC protocol.

However, this problem can be tackled with the effective design of WSN-IoT by clustering and sleep scheduling mechanisms. This paper addresses this issue by presenting novel ideas involved in the WSN operations such as grid construction, cluster head selection, sleep scheduling, and data gathering by intelligent Agents (iAgents). An energy-efficient dual iAgents based Heterogeneous WSN (E2IA-HWSN) is proposed. iAgents are used in this paper to automatically collect the sensed data from IoT sensors. In this E2IA-HWSN, a 3 × 3 grid is built and each cell is sub-divided into four in which cluster heads (CH) are selected in each sub-division, followed by ring partitioning for selecting a CH present at the center. Multi-Objective Harris Hawks optimization (MO-HHO) algorithm is used to select CH and supernode, here to minimize the energy consumption of CH, the supernode takes responsibility to assign sleep schedules to devices. The scheduling slots are assigned only after a sensor reaches below the energy threshold. For scheduling, the Bayes rule-based Markov model (BR-MM) is applied with the determination of residual energy and sensed packet counts. Generator de Bits Pseudo Aleatorios (GBPA) eliminates redundant data in CH and then inter-cluster routing is performed in case of emergency events. If not, then the CH waits for the arrival of iagents, the trajectory of iAgents is dynamically predicted with Deep Policy Gradient (DDPG). The implementation is carried out in NS3.26 and the results show betterment to the well-known methods.",30 September 2021,Wireless Personal Communications,"G. Susan Shiny,B.

However, managing energy consumption is more critical because of the movable environment. Several existing models have addressed these energy management issues. Still, those models lack in optimizing the energy usage of the WSN during the collision environment. This has motivated to find the best solution for energy optimization with an intelligent model. So, the present research article aims to develop the novel Buffalo-based Deep Belief Energy Management Framework (BDBEMF) for the WSN application. Initially, the required number of sensor nodes was created then the BDBEMF was designed to monitor the high consumption nodes. In addition, the Low-energy adaptive-clustering-hierarchy protocol has been considered for the communication process. Consequently, the Cluster Head has been selected based on less energy utilization and high-density hubs. The data rate of each node has been measured, and the high leaded data has been shared to work fewer nodes to balance the energy. Finally, the amount of alive and dead nodes was validated with few communication metrics.

IoT networks enable smart devices to compile environmental information and transmit it to demanding users through an IoT gateway. The explosive increase of IoT users and sensors causes network bottlenecks, leading to significant energy depletion in IoT devices. The wireless network is a robust, empirically significant, and IoT layer based on progressive characteristics. The development of energy-efficient routing protocols for learning purposes is critical due to environmental volatility, unpredictability, and randomness in the wireless network’s weight distribution. To achieve this critical need, learning-based routing systems are emerging as potential candidates due to their high degree of flexibility and accuracy. However, routing becomes more challenging in dynamic IoT networks due to the time-varying characteristics of link connections and access status. Hence, modern learning-based routing systems must be capable of adapting in real-time to network changes. This research presents an intelligent fault detection, energy-efficient, quality-of-service routing technique based on reinforcement learning to find the optimum route with the least amount of end-to-end latency.

Some real applications impose combined environments of fixed and mobile sensor nodes in the same network, while others demand a complete mobile sensors environment. Packet loss that occurs due to mobility of the sensor nodes is one of the main challenges which comes in parallel with energy consumption. In this paper, we use cross layer design between medium access control (MAC) and network layers to overcome these challenges. Thus, a cluster based routing protocol for mobile sensor nodes (CBR-Mobile) is proposed. The CBR-Mobile is mobility and traffic adaptive protocol. The timeslots assigned to the mobile sensor nodes that had moved out of the cluster or have not data to send will be reassigned to incoming sensor nodes within the cluster region. The protocol introduces two simple databases to achieve the mobility and traffic adaptively. The proposed protocol sends data to cluster heads in an efficient manner based on received signal strength. In CBR-Mobile protocol, cluster based routing collaborates with hybrid MAC protocol to support mobility of sensor nodes. Schedule timeslots are used to send the data message while the contention timeslots are used to send join registration messages.

In this paper, we have achieved energy savings by introducing duty cycle in an aggregation based cooperative-MIMO (CMIMO) framework. In the proposed CMIMO framework, instead of opting for the complete centralized or distributed approach, an optimum number of node performs aggregation and long haul transmissions which not only saves energy but also increases the reliability of the network. The aggregator and the long haul link nodes are selected based on the residual energy level. The role of a node to behave as an aggregator and/or long haul link node is rotated after certain number of rounds and duty cycle is implemented accordingly. This ensures load balancing which eventually leads to lifetime enhancement. The effect of varying the cluster size, the number of aggregator nodes and the long haul links on the average energy consumption have also been analysed. The result shows that by introducing duty cycle in an aggregation based framework contributes to a significant amount of energy savings. On an average 42.50% of energy is saved in the proposed framework when compared CMIMO without any data aggregation. And this energy saving is up to 99% when compared to the conventional single node transmission.",23 January 2020,Wireless Personal Communications,"Sarah Asheer,Sanjeet Kumar","(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering,BIT Mesra,Ranchi,Jharkhand,India)",India

Increasing the energy efficiency of the WSN is a considerable aspect of concern, as higher energy consumption of sensor nodes decreases the existence of the network. Therefore, the energy utilization of sensor nodes plays an essential role in improving the lifetime of the WSN. Many existing methods use static sinks and multi-hop routing for data gathering that can cause an energy-hole problem and inadequate data gathering. Recent studies show that clustering can minimize energy usage of sensor nodes and mobile data collector (MDC) is used to gather sensor data by regularly visiting the nodes to avoid a hotspot or energy-hole problem. Thus, the use of enhanced clustering approach and MDC can improve the data gathering efficiency and cut down the energy consumption of the WSN. In this study, we have developed a JayaX with local search module-based cluster head selection (JayaX-LSM-CHS) approach and cluster formation method and adopted an ant colony optimization (ACO)-based algorithm for an efficient data gathering. The performance of the proposed framework (PF) is validated and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely dynamic clustering with ant colony optimization (DC-ACO), improved clustering with particle swarm optimization (IC-PSO), and LEACH protocol.

Therefore, the proper selection of CHs plays vital role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster head selection algorithm which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) called PSO-ECHS. The algorithm is developed with an efficient scheme of particle encoding and fitness function. For the energy efficiency of the proposed PSO approach, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes.

Generally, the lifetime of any WSN is restricted due to the limited battery capacities available with its sensor nodes. Replenishing the nodes’ batteries through energy-harvesting is becoming popular nowadays for improving the lifetime of the WSNs. Wireless communication activities of the sensor nodes take a major chunk of battery’s energy during WSN operations and to optimize the energy dissipation, energy-efficiency is given prime importance in routing decisions. The WSN heterogeneity (e.g., sensor nodes with heterogeneous sensing requirements, nodes with different energies, etc.) has become unavoidable and its effective exploitation further complicates the routing challenges. To fulfill the requirements of a realistic WSN system, this paper considers a multi-heterogeneity WSN scenario with sensors nodes having different initial energies and different traffic requirements along with solar energy-harvesting capabilities. An improved cluster-head selection based routing algorithm is proposed for the scenario, which exploits effectively the WSN heterogeneities in terms of energy, traffic and energy-harvesting. To highlight the performance of the proposed algorithm, the system is considered non energy-neutral, i.e. the energy dissipation of the system is higher than the system’s harvesting energy over a longer time period. The proposed algorithm, Energy-Harvesting, Traffic and Energy Aware Routing, improves the WSN stability period over existing routing algorithms under the scenario, where the stability period signifies the WSN lifetime till all the nodes are alive and represents the most reliable period of an operational WSN.",11 May 2019,Wireless Personal Communications,"Deepak Sharma,Amol P.

As such, the so-called low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) was presented to prolong the lifetime of a WSN. Although the original idea of LEACH is to keep each sensor in a WSN from being chosen as a cluster head (CH) too frequently so that the loading of the sensors will be balanced, thus avoiding particular sensors from running out of their energy quickly and particular regions from failing to work, it is far from perfect because LEACH may select an unsuitable set of sensors as the cluster heads. In this paper, a high-performance hyper-heuristic algorithm will be presented to enhance the clustering results of WSN called hyper-heuristic clustering algorithm (HHCA). The proposed algorithm is designed to reduce the energy consumption of a WSN, by using a high-performance metaheuristic algorithm to find a better solution to balance the residual energy of all the sensors so that the number of alive sensor nodes will be maximized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is compared with LEACH, LEACH with genetic algorithm, and hyper-heuristic algorithm alone in this study.

Transferring the intensive computing of the clustering approach to the cloud can boost the efficiency and lifespan of IoT nodes. However, the open cloud environment has vulnerabilities in security and privacy. To address the issue of IoT node privacy, fully homomorphic encryption is applied to the data prior to cloud-based k-medoid clustering, which enables computations to be performed on encrypted data. Additionally, to increase the lifetime of the medoids, the proposed protocol considers the selection of medoids when the remaining energy of the current medoid drops below a threshold amount. The suggested protocol’s performance is compared to that of the I-Leach and R-Leach protocols based on parameters such as the number of alive nodes, the amount of residual energy, network lifetime, and network stability under various conditions. The simulation results show that the suggested protocol performs better than I-Leach and R-Leach in the scenarios taken into consideration by attaining more residual energy and extending the network lifetime.",27 November 2022,Cluster Computing,"N.

The major constraint of WSNs is the limited power supply, which impacts the lifecycle of the entire network. Clustering is a performing method used in WSNs to optimize power consumption and extend the lifetime of WSNs. LEACH is considered the first classical clustering protocol used in WSNs to optimize energy consumption. Many protocols have been developed to enhance the conventional LEACH protocol. BRE-LEACH (Balanced Residual Energy LEACH) is one of them. It is used to enhance the performance of the LEACH protocol. In this paper, we propose a new improved BRE-LEACH protocol called IBRE-LEACH (Improved Balanced Residual Energy LEACH), which improves the performance of the BRE-LEACH approach. The IBRE-LEACH combines clustering and multi-hop techniques. It selects CHs according to the residual energy and limits the maximum number of nodes in each cluster to balance the energy consumption. Thus, IBRE-LEACH allows the Abandoned Nodes to send their data to the BS. Furthermore, it routes the gathered data using CHs, ANs, and a root node, which is a node with maximum residual energy and minimum distance to the BS. The simulation results in MATLAB show that the IBRE-LEACH protocol increases the throughput, optimizes energy consumption, extends network lifetime, and ameliorates stability by 81.99%, 94.33%, and 91.47% compared to BRE-LEACH, LEACH-C, and LEACH, respectively.",21 June 2022,Wireless Personal Communications,"Ikram Daanoune,Abdennaceur Baghdad","(Faculty of Sciences and Techniques,Hassan II University of Casablanca,BP 146,20650,Mohammedia,Morocco)",Morocco

It employs large number of sensor nodes, which will perform various operations like data gathering, transmission and forwarding. An optimal Q-learning based clustering and load balancing technique using improved K-Means algorithm is proposed. It contains two phases namely clustering phase and node balancing phase. The proposed algorithm uses Q-learning technique for deploying sensor nodes in appropriate clusters and cluster head CH election. In the clustering phase, the node will be placed in appropriate clusters based on the computation of the mean values. Once the sensors are placed in an appropriate cluster, then the cluster will be divided into ‘k’ partitions. The node which is having maximum residual energy in each partition will be elected as the partition head PH. In node balancing phase, the number of sensors in each partition will be evenly distributed by considering the area of the cluster and the number of sensors inside the cluster. Among the PHs, the node which is having residual energy to the maximum and also having the minimal distance to the sink is elected as the CH. The residual energy of the CH is monitored periodically. If it falls below the threshold level, then another partition head PH which is having residual energy to the maximum level and possessing minimum distance to the sink node will be elected as CH. The proposed Q-Learning based clustering technique maximize the reward by considering the throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption. Finally, the performance of the Q-learning based clustering algorithm is evaluated and compared existing k-means based clustering algorithms.

In energy-efficient scheduling, only a subset of the deployed sensor nodes is enabled to monitor the targets. As sensor nodes have restricted communication and sensing range, coverage and network connectivity should be considered while scheduling with fewer sensor nodes. For guaranteed transmission of sensing data from every target point to the base station, connectivity and coverage are the most pivotal issues in the scheduling of sensor nodes. In this research article, we have presented the energy-efficient active/sleep scheduling of the sensor nodes using a genetic algorithm (GA) with Dither Creeping mutation in which only few sensors are activated that ensures the coverage to all targets as well as communication with the sensor nodes and base station (BS). The novelty of the proposed GA with crossover and Dither Creeping mutation (GACDCM) is that the mutation probability is generated randomly rather than the fixed value for each string. As a result, for the same generation, the various strings of the proposed algorithm will be subjected to various creeping mutation probabilities and the same string is subjected to various creeping mutation probabilities at successive generations. The proposed algorithm replaces the traditional bitwise mutation. For exploring the search space in case of extremely constrained problems, Dither Creeping Mutation is more efficient than bitwise mutation. We have simulated the proposed algorithm extensively with several WSN scenarios. the simulation results are analyzed with the existent algorithms to validate the efficiency of the presented algorithm.

Since communication consumes the most energy, efficient routing becomes an effective solution. A typical routing strategy is to use hierarchical clustering algorithms. In hierarchical routing schemes, a clustered arrangement of sensor nodes (SNs) is used to facilitate data merging and aggregation. The Cluster heads are in charge of obtaining data from the cluster’s SNs and gathering and delivering the data they receive at BS. These data are combined and pooled at the Cluster head (CH) level, resulting in considerable energy savings. However, there are certain reliability issues in cluster head selection (CHS) and optimal routing. To model a CHS and optimal routing in WSN, this work carries out the CHS using improved kernel Fuzzy C means clustering for selecting the CH by considering energy and distance. Then, optimal routing is done by deploying a novel optimization scheme named Customized Pelican with Blue Monkey Optimization (CP-BMO), which offers the optimal routes by considering trust and risk constraints.

Taylor-spotted hyena optimization algorithm for reliable and energy-efficient cluster head selection based secure data routing and failure tolerance in WSN,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-022-12302-7,15,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor network (WSN),Network failure,Route maintenance,Cluster head (CH) selection,And data routing","Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) comprises sensor nodes, and these nodes are generally battery-powered such that the batteries are not recharged because of their inaccessibility in the hostile environment. WSN is prone to node or link failure due to environmental hazards, like internal and interference faults in the sensor nodes. The link failure can result in network disconnection, so the data cannot get the path to Base Station or sink node. The link failure degrades the quality of the network in a hostile environment. To mitigate this issue and tolerate network failure, an effective Cluster Head (CH) selection mechanism is devised by the developed Taylor-Spotted Hyena Optimization (Taylor-SHO), which integrates the Taylor series with Spotted Hyena Optimization (SHO). The proposed approach is employed for the effective CH selection process using fitness measure depending on energy, distance, and delay. Then, the data routing is done by the modified k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (mod-kVDPR) algorithm, which is derived by modifying kVDPR using the parameters, such as link reliability and throughput. At last, the route maintenance is engaged to observe the delivery operation of data packets and report the link failure. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using simulation network with 50 nodes and 10 nodes. Also, the proposed scheme is compared with Distributed Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering approach, Grey Wolf Optimizer, Tabu particle swarm optimization, and Herding Optimization-Greedy conventional techniques.

This can be done using sensors and internet enabled devices in the farm. The underlying wireless sensor network can sense various environmental parameters and can pass data to the internet enabled devices to support smart farming. The sensor nodes are, however, powered by smaller batteries and have limited lifetime. Therefore, this paper presents a clustering protocol which aims at increasing the lifetime of the sensor nodes. These sensors are considered to be pressure sensors which are deployed in the network and whenever any animal encroaches the farm, a signal can be passed to the internet enabled alarm system which can help the farmer to fend off the animals and protect his crops. The sensor network is considered to have three level of energy heterogeneity among the nodes and the cluster head is selected in such a way that the cluster formed by the head consists of more number of high energy nodes. The proposed protocol has been simulated in MATLAB environment and compared with Stable Election Protocol (SEP), Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC) and Improved Stable Election Protocol (ISEP) based on network lifetime and throughput.

Also, sensor nodes distribute based on network usage. One of the most significant issues in this type of network is the energy consumption of sensor nodes. In fixed-sink networks, nodes which are near the sink act as an interface to transfer data of other nodes to sink. This causes the energy consumption of sensors reduces rapidly. Therefore, the lifetime of the network declines. Sensor nodes owing to their weaknesses are susceptible to several threats, one of which is denial-of-sleep attack (DoSA) threatening WSN. Hence, the DoSA refers to the energy loss in these nodes by maintaining the nodes from entering energy-saving and sleep mode. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on mobile sink, firefly algorithm based on leach, and Hopfield neural network (WSN-FAHN). Thus, mobile sink is applied to both improve energy consumption and increase network lifetime. Firefly algorithm is proposed to cluster nodes and authenticate in two levels to prevent from DoSA. In addition, Hopfield neural network detects the direction route of the sink movement to send data of CH. Furthermore, here WSN-FAHN technique is assessed through wide simulations performed in the NS-2 environment.

Localization is considered as the most important and interesting area in WSN as identifying the location of sensor nodes is needful for many situations. The proposed work, points on discovering the sensor node location and promotes cross layer effective routing path searching for the reliable data transmission in the network. The proposed work consists of three main phases. The initial phase includes the cross-layer link establishment. The second phase includes, identifying the fuzziness of wireless sensors. It tracks the location of sensor nodes and analyzes the behaviour. This can be done with the algorithm namely; Fuzziness based Contiguous nodes Refining Algorithm. Since the characteristics of nodes may vary often, the algorithm finds the unsuitable communication node in the routing path and removes it. Source node controls the activities of the intermediate nodes in the routing path. After identifying and removing the unsuitable nodes, in final phase, an effective routing path is established by using the scheme called Efficient Fuzziness based Contiguous node refining with cross-layer routing Scheme (EFCRS) is proposed. This selects the routing nodes from starting node to ending node with the lesser energy usage. At last, destination node acquires the enhanced throughput and reduced consumption of energy.

Cluster heads are selected from the sensor nodes based on several key parameters like residual energy of the cluster heads candidates, the distance of cluster heads from their cluster members, and the distance between cluster head and the base station. Cluster formation deals with the association of sensor nodes with one of the selected cluster heads. This paper presents an energy-efficient clustering algorithm with linearly decreasing inertia weight particle swarm optimization (PSO) and improved weight factor. The interia weight PSO is based on cluster head selection and the improved weight factor-based cluster formation. The merit of the proposed approach is the robust formulation of a linear weight factor that leads to efficient cluster formation.

In a UAV-assisted wireless sensor network (UAV-WSN), the sensor nodes are installed at the ground and a UAV works as the sink node. The UAV-based sink flies over the sensed region and receives the data packets of surrounding ground nodes. A UAV-WSN offers improved data collection efficiency as the UAV-based sink avoids the ground obstacles and establishes line-of-sight communication with the ground sensor nodes. However, the UAV’s flight trajectory needs to be optimized to achieve minimized UAV energy consumption during flight operation and minimized node energy consumption in data transmission. This paper presents a hybrid data routing protocol for UAV-WSN that considers optimized planning of the UAV’s flight trajectory in parallel with energy-efficient data communication amid ground sensor nodes and the UAV. The presented scheme utilizes multi-objective NSGA-II optimization heuristics to optimize UAV’s flight trajectory. The developed NSGA-II model evolves into an optimal UAV flight trajectory that simultaneously achieves the objectives of minimized UAV energy consumption, minimized node energy consumption, and maximized average RSSI.

Therefore, in order to solve this problem, it is necessary to reduce the energy consumption of data transmission in the routing protocol and increase the network life cycle. However, there is also a problem that cluster heads count with a wide range and the cluster head forwarding data consumed greatly power in the LEACH, which remains to be solved. In this paper, we put forward an approach to optimize the routing protocol. Firstly, the optimal number of cluster head is calculated according to the overall energy consumption per round to reduce the probability of excessive cluster head distribution. Then, the cluster head is used as the core to construct the Voronoi Diagram. The nodes in the same Voronoi diagram become a cluster, that the energy consumption communication in intra-cluster would be less. Finally, in order to optimize the multi-hop routing protocol, an ant colony algorithm is added using a cluster head near the BS to receive and forward it from a remote cluster head. According to the MATLAB simulation data, the protocol can significantly prolong the lifetime of WSNs compared with the LEACH protocol and increase the energy efficiency per unit node in per round.

In IoT, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the commonly used technology today. But when dealing with WSN, it is highly prone to data security and energy efficiency during data transmission, due to interference in transmission path and transmission of big size of data. Existing mechanisms have used multiple accessing techniques for effective transmission but failed in transmission due to less memory storage of sensor node and also lacked in preserving originality of the compressed data due to bad compression ratio. So, to deal with this scenario, a compressive slender penetrative etiquette is designed as our proposed work for effective transmission of data in WSNs that attains high data transmission rate with diminishing of interference and attenuation. The optimal way for transferring data with limited energy is achieved with a compressive sensing technique called Chaotic Demodulation Stratagem. It makes use of a Mock Random Generator which generates a high-speed sequence which multiplies the signal in the analog domain. The obtained output from the low pass filter is then supposed to sampling process at a rate lower than the Nyquist rate.

It further helps in acquiring the traffic load balancing in the whole network. Recently, a plethora of research is reported that combines the clustering with CS in three genres; a plain CS, hybrid CS and a multi-path hybrid CS. However, the number transmissions are too high by the nodes (plain CS) or by the Cluster Heads (CHs) (hybrid or multi-path hybrid). While adopting the aforementioned genres of CS-based clustering, the selection of CH has not been given significant attention. This results in inevitable reduction the network lifetime of IoT-based WSN. Therefore, to extenuate the aforementioned concerns, in this paper, two contributions are reported. Firstly, the CH selection is done by the energy, distance, node density and average energy of the network that helps in the befitting CH selection of a node. Consequently, data gathering is improved and compression is done at the CH level. Secondly, the data reconstruction is also made better as compared to the state-of-the-art protocols helping in enhancing the Signal to Noise Ratio.

Sensor nodes in the WSN are battery operated; therefore, recharging or replacement of the sensor node is a crucial task. Efficient energy consumption of sensor nodes is one of the significant challenges in WSN. In cluster based WSN, sensor nodes are grouped to form clusters. Gateway collects data from sensor nodes, aggregates data and transmits to the base station directly or through other gateways using the routing path. This causes heavy traffic load at the sink and forms an energy hole around the sink. In this paper, an energy efficient routing structure using the multi-layer network model is proposed to avoid the energy hole around the sink. The routing structure considers the one-to-one connection for all gateways to balance the overall load on the network. In the designed network model, the number of gateways increases in each layer towards the sink to minimize the traffic load around the sink.
