Cluster Localization of Sensor Nodes Using Learning Movement Patterns,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17878-8_16,none,conference,Springer,none,"In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), localization system is required in order to provide position information to sensor nodes. The cost and limited energy resource associated with common, mobile nodes prohibits them from carrying relatively expensive devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS). This paper proposes a mechanism that allows non-GPS-equipped nodes in the network to derive their approximated locations from a limited number of GPS-equipped nodes. A Non-GPS equipped node uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to know the position of the node using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). To enhance lifetime, an efficient clustering scheme is used for localizing the nodes of HMM with Random Walk Mobility (RWM) model.

The cluster head (CH) is responsible for the creation of the network dominating set, the maintenance of the network topology structure and the data collection. Each cluster head is responsible for managing all nodes belonging to its subset. In this paper, we propose a new distributed clustering algorithm called HCMA based on a previous algorithm. The HCMA algorithm calculates the link state between nodes, node congestion state and energy consumption of nodes as the mixed measure in order to elect the cluster head. This solution is primarily intended to provide better performance, such as the maximum survival time, and reduce the packet loss rate. The simulation results show that HCMA can reduce the packet loss quantity and improve the network lifetime compared with other similar methods.",21 April 2016,Software Engineering Perspectives and Application in Intelligent Systems,"Bo Dong,Xue Wang","(Computing Center of Liaoning University,Shenyang,Liaoning,China),(Information Technology Center of Liaoning University,Shenyang,Liaoning,China)","China,China"

In last 15 years, wireless sensor network (WSN)-based and internet of things (IoT)-based system effect human on every aspect of our life. WSN grows in rapid pace as it emerges as one of the most important technological developments. Since its emergence, the wireless sensor network (WSN) constitutes one of the most important technological developments in the last decade. It has the potential to affect our lifestyle deeply. However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. The IoT-based architectures are intelligent applications that make energy, logistics, industrial control, retail, agriculture, and many other domains “smarter.” With emergence of wireless sensor network as Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet, that is, rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, and networking and cloud technologies. With rapidly increasing wireless sensor network (WSN)- and internet of thing (IoT)-based services; a lot of data is generated. It is becoming very difficult to manage power constrained small sensors and other data-generating devices. WSN or IoTs enables anything can become part of the Internet and generate data. Moreover, data generation needs to be managed according to its requirements, to create more valuable services. For this purpose, integration of WSN or IoTs with cloud computing is becoming very important. The small IoT sensors deployed in agricultural fields measuring the vast amount of information using sensors like air pressure, environmental temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, soil moisture, soil temperature, wind speed, leaf wetness, CO concentration and N, P, and K concentration.

Service Provisioning Middleware for Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-2695-6_28,3,conference,Springer,none,"Earlier, wireless sensor network (WSN) applications tended to follow the traditional format of being specific to a device. Later, when applications evolved integrating heterogeneous devices, it rendered difficulty in enforcing a common standard among all the diverse devices. In order to handle this, a lot of WSN middleware platforms emerged to bind the application interaction with the heterogeneous devices through heterogeneous interfaces. This started increasing the service-based applications while decreasing the device-based applications. Apart from not only providing the classic task of reading the information from the sensor network, the middleware support were extended to address interoperability, management, security, and privacy. However, still there exists an important issue, which many of the existing middleware fail to address. For instance, the network design scenario varies depending on the application context. However, most of the existing middleware operate on the default network infrastructure and data dissemination protocol to collect the data and perform other tasks on the network. Therefore, there is a requirement to include support for customizing the network configuration for an application requirement with respect to its context. Hence, in this work, a service provisioning middleware based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) is proposed. To support network customization, in the middleware layer, a decision algorithm is proposed. It is used for generating the configuration file according to the application requirement. This service provisioning middleware would serve as a generic model for adapting to the required network environment.",25 October 2015,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Frontiers in Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications (FICTA) 2015,"S.

A Comparative Analysis of Energy Consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-5640-8_10,2,conference,Springer,none,"Over the last decades, manufacturers, researchers and users have paid sufficient attention to the wireless sensor network (WSN), especially for managing and monitored tasks with a limited lifetime and greater reliability and durability to effectively collect data in a variety of environments. However, the main goal is to minimize energy usage by maximizing network life in the creation of applications and protocols. This paper highlights several research recommendations on energy usage at WSN, with assessments of various energy consumption and cluster stability schemes. Then, the research conducted a comparative study between the protocols and logarithms that effectively contributed to reducing energy consumption in these types of networks.

Improvements to network longevity and energy efficiency are the main goals of IoT-based WSNs, hence several clustering techniques are suggested to reduce energy consumption. To boost capacity in a multi-path channel environment, IoT devices are currently incorporated via several communication interfaces, often known as multiple-in and multiple-out (MIMO) in 5G networks. Every interface has unique qualities that could be desired as well as helpful in certain user contexts. A robust clustering approach for highly active IoT systems is lacking and must be developed in order to support a variety of user applications, especially as MIMO becomes more readily accessible on IoT devices. The energy efficiency and network longevity are enhanced in the proposed system, MIMO-based energy-centric routing protocol (MIMO-ECRP), for usage on the IoT in the 5G context as well as later on. The MIMO-ECRP method uses both types of topologies (i.e., a multi-hop configuration enabling inter-cluster communication or a single-hop configuration with intra-cluster communication) and the K-means-based network partition technique to cluster the nodes. In order to avoid redundant information transfer, threshold-based criteria have been provided in simulations as well as practical applications whilst minimal changes get observed.

Energy-efficient Next Hop Selection for Topology Creation in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29313-9_26,none,conference,Springer,none,"Topology creation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been one of the main criteria for a better routing experience. Recently, many fields have adopted WSNs for better ease of data collection and monitoring applications. However, most of these applications oblige the long-term deployment of the network and less frequency of sensor maintenance. Hence, it is necessary for the WSN to be sustainable in order for a longer lifetime and failure immunity. One of the main contributors in these goals is topology formation. Faster and efficient topology formation in WSNs allows for faster and reliable packet delivery, as well as reduced energy consumption and faster network deployment. However, as WSN applications have become more diverse, WSNs require efficient and faster topology creation methods. Thus, in this paper, we present the design of a novel method for next hop selection in WSNs for optimal topology creation. The approach aims to improve energy consumption, increase network lifetime, and improve packet delivery ratio. The method offers three modes for hop selection based on distance, energy, and a balanced mode that takes into consideration both of these measures. The main point of this approach is limiting the number of next hop candidates for each node by focusing on neighbors that are in the direction to the Base Station (BS). This is done by narrowing the angle at which the node is allowed to choose its next hop. The algorithm was tested and was able to extend network lifetime as well as increase the number of packets delivered to the BS.

EDA-PEGASIS: A Balanced Energy Aware Routing Approach for Sensor Network to Reduce Cognitive Networking Complexities in Wireless Medium,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-7504-4_57,none,conference,Springer,none,"The area of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) unwraps lots of challenges to the field of cognitive networking largely, in the modern era of communication and network engineering. The basis step to tackle the issue related to listening/receiving the data is to introduce effective methodologies in the way of communicating with the nodes in the network. The paper proposes an improvement to the design of WSN formation, where the battery operated Wireless sensor nodes (or nodes)transmits data continously to the Base station (or sink)addressing the challenges in improving QoS parameters and Energy management of nodes. In this paper, we propose a modified version of PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System) protocol namely EDA-PEGASIS (Euclidean Distance Assisted – PEGASIS) to improve the lifetime of network by creating partial chains in data gathering after initial run and re-electing the leader node (LN) after energy level of the transmitting node falls below a threshold value by including Euclidean distance as a constraint. The nodes once acted as a LN will not be re-elected until energy level of all the nodes nearing to sink are below the threshold value. As a result, the average energy spent by each node per round is reduced which in turn lower the bandwidth requirement thereby achieving less power dissipation benchmark to increase efficiency and lifetime of the network. Further, this design of communication of nodes using EDA-PEGASIS will help to reduce the computational complexities in Cognitive Network.",21 January 2021,Advances in Power Systems and Energy Management,"S.

An Energy-Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on K-Means Clustering,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-41968-3_31,2,conference,Springer,none,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently gained much attention from researchers due to their large potential for practical applications. One of the most critical problems in WSN research is to prolong the network lifetime, given that sensor nodes are only equipped with energy-limited batteries. Clustering sensor nodes and then routing the transmission of data to the base station via cluster heads (CHs) is an effective approach to this problem. In this paper, we first analyze the problem of selecting cluster centers as CHs which may quickly exhaust their energy. Then we propose a new k-means-based routing (KMR) protocol, where the selection of CHs is randomized so as to better distribute the transmission load among sensor nodes of the same cluster. The simulation results on OMNeT++ show that our method KMR can make a substantial improvement in the network lifetime compared with some existing methods, including LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy).",2014,AETA 2013: Recent Advances in Electrical Engineering and Related Sciences,"Thai T.

An Energy-Balanced Strategy for Clustering Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11943952_52,none,conference,Springer,none,Energy is one of the most important factors in the design of routing protocols in wireless sensor networks. This paper first analyzes the energy consumption in typical clustering protocols and finds that the consumption is not evenly distributed among nodes. Thus some nodes die quickly with the reduction of the network lifetime. Then a new energy-balanced strategy is introduced in clustering protocols. The strategy assigns the head communication load to base station by detecting the energy consumption in the cluster heads. The evenly distributed energy among the nodes is realized by controlling the head consumption. Simulation results show that the lifetime of the network is significantly prolonged with the new energy-balanced strategy.,2006,Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks,"Feng Zhao,Feng Xi,Zhong Liu","(Department of Electronic Engineering,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,Jiangsu,210094,The People’s Republic of China)",China

Due to their vulnerability to different types of attacks, safeguarding them requires unique security solutions. Among the potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on WSNs, the Misdirection attack is particularly challenging to identify and counteract. This attack occurs when a malicious node within the network redirects incoming packets to unintended destinations, leading to increased network delays, sometimes to an infinite extent. Consequently, this also leads to a reduction in network throughput. Therefore, detecting and preventing Misdirection attacks is a critical and complex task. In this study, a new approach has been introduced to detect and isolate these malevolent nodes responsible for instigating such attacks. This innovative method relies on a threshold-based technique. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using Ns2, and the results have been evaluated in terms of factors like delay, energy consumption, and data throughput.

A Grid-Based Approach to Prolong Lifetime of WSNs Using Fuzzy Logic,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-2525-9_2,4,conference,Springer,none,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are autonomous, self-configured and consist of distributed sensors for monitoring any physical or environmental conditions. Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station.

A Fuzzy Based Clustering Approach to Prolong the Network Lifetime in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93247-3_11,none,conference,Springer,none,"The selection of cluster heads (CHs) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is still a crucial issue to reduce the consumed energy in each node and increase the network lifetime. Therefore, in this paper an energy-efficient modified LEACH protocol based on the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is suggested to find the optimal number of CHs. The fuzzy chance is combined with the probability of CH selection in LEACH to produce a new selection criterion. The FLC system depends on two inputs of the residual energy of each node and the node distance from the base station (sink node). Accordingly, the modified clustering protocol can improve the network lifetime, decrease the consumed energy, and send more information than the original LEACH protocol.

In order to achieve an energy-efficient path plan, this paper highlights the importance of considering parameters from sensor nodes beyond just UAV travel distance. For example, residual battery and buffer size of sensor nodes are equally important in enhancing data collection, reducing energy consumption, minimising data loss and extending the lifetime of WSNs. The paper presents an extract from a proposed algorithm that demonstrates how to generate UAV path plans based on the dynamic resources of the WSN. This algorithm harnesses parallelism by dividing WSN into clusters. The path plans only include a subset of sensors that interact with the UAV, serving as waypoints in the traversal process. The cost of each path plan is assessed by our proposed system model, which considers the energy-consuming actions the sensors can perform. Graph theory is used to map the problem of UAV path plan generation to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).",14 April 2024,Euro-Par 2023: Parallel Processing Workshops,"Ruben Enrique Padilla Robles,Rizos Sakellariou","(Department of Computer Science,University of Manchester,Manchester,UK)",
Exploiting Common Nodes in Overlapped Clusters for Path Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-2526-3_23,none,conference,Springer,none,"For operational efficiency, most WSNs employ clustering approach where the cluster head is responsible for finding the shortest path to the sink for all of its cluster nodes. While clustering, it is a common observation that the clusters often tend to overlap, and hence nodes in the overlap region are capable of communicating directly with neighboring nodes within one hop distance. However, traditionally the nodes belonging to one cluster are prohibited from making overtures with other nodes outside its cluster. A common node exploitation (CNE) approach is proposed that deviates from this traditional approach and paves a methodology to exploit the proximity of the common nodes to the other nodes. Two algorithms are developed based on CNE approach for location aware, randomly deployed WSNs to find alternate, shorter, and optimized path to the sink.

In WSN, the resource of energy is restricted. Energy efficient clustering solutions are required to keep a long lifetime and enough data packets by extending the run time of CHs. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering solution to improve the selection and rotation of CHs. The presented solution includes two key parts: a new cluster selection based on the distance to the energy-centroid of the cluster and a new cluster rotation solution based on the residual energy level of the node in order to evenly distribute the energy load among all sensors nodes. In particular, the distance between the node and the energy-centroid in EEC when it comes to the rotation of the cluster head node. Our simulation is based on the platform NS-2. The simulate part presents the performance comparison among EEC and the conventional protocols such as LEACH and LEACH-C in terms of energy efficient, the network lifetime and data packets received by the BS. It is worth noting that EEC outperforms the existing protocols from our simulation results.

The most important challenge of WSN is how to extend its lifetime. For long distance communication, using one hop transmission causes the dissipation of a lot of energy. To avoid this dissipation, an energy-efficient multihop transmission strategy based on Dijkstra algorithm is proposed in this paper. We consider a WSN organized into clusters, each cluster is composed of N sensor nodes classified as follows: source node, cluster head (CH) node as the destination, group of active nodes and group of sleeping nodes. The selection of CH node is based on the position of nodes within the cluster and their residual energy. Then, the CH groups the remaining nodes into active or sleeping nodes according to a reference distance. We suppose that the transmitting symbol is correctly received only if the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver is above a threshold \(\gamma _{th}\). Our main objective is to define a new transmission technique minimizing the power consumption using multihop communication. The selected relays which cooperate to aid the source-destination communication are those offering the least transmit power while maintaining SNR equal to the threshold \(\gamma _{th}\).

To over- come the energy consumption issue, a powerful method i.e. clustering is used in order to improve the scalability and lifespan of the sensor network. But, in mobile WSNs (MWSNs) due to the movement of the sensor nodes (SNs) packet loss arise and hence is a major problem for MWSNs. To overwhelm this problem, current researchers have proposed many clustering schemes for MWSNs considering the mobility of SNs into account, but many of the given schemes overload the cluster head (CH). To conquer this problem in WSN, many researchers gave the idea of using fuzzy logic (FL) for MWSNs for electing the appropriate CH. A SN that is elected as CH on the basis of FL is ef- ficient in terms of flexibility and have the ability to distribute the load among SNs equally thus can enhance the lifetime of the sensor network.

The realization of any wireless sensor network (WSNs) clearly determined on how the key quality of service (QoS) attributes/non-functional requirements (NFRs) gets accomplished. The well-known issues to be taken into account while designing WSNs for setting up smarter environments are information precision (timeliness and accuracy), data accretion, network latency, and energy efficiency. A wisely employed clustering algorithm for interconnecting sensor nodes can significantly enhance the energy efficiency of WSNs. However, the aspect of clustering involves additional overheads due to cluster head selection and cluster construction. This research work proposes a workaround that utilizes Type-II fuzzy for fusing the data and tree driven clustering algorithm that employs Type-2 fuzzy logic to improve the QoS parameters as well as preserving the power/energy of sensor networks. The primary objectives of the proposed cluster algorithm are two folded. Firstly, it constructs the clusters and chooses the cluster head (CH) by considering the remaining energy in the nodes and its distance from the base station (BS). Secondly, it performs the data fusion which contains meaningful information that has been sensed and captured. An extensive experimental analysis has been done on the proposed FBDF-TBC method by comparing it against its counterparts. The simulation results conclude that the proposed fuzzy-based technique for data fusion and tree-based clustering routing algorithm (FBDF-TBC) outperforms other clustering algorithms and improves the overall network lifetime of WSN from a minimum of 16% to maximum of 76%.",21 October 2017,Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications,"Veeramuthu Venkatesh,Pethuru Raj,P.

Many existing energy efficiency protocols are proposed to address energy optimization for wireless sensor networks. However, most of them have weaken to take into account the factor of end-to-end delay. This paper investigates to find the best trade-off between two objectives: minimizing the energy consumption and end-to-end delay in wireless sensor network. We first propose a new energy-cost function for the inter-cluster routing algorithm. Next, we provide a k-least routes algorithm which is used to disseminate sensing data from clusterheads to sink with minimum energy consumption subject to an end-to-end delay constraint. We evaluate the effectiveness of the energy balance between cost functions by simulation. In addtion, the extended simulations show that our proposal performs much better than similar protocols in terms of energy consumption and end-to-end delay.

There are two components in the proposed model, the first supports the development of clusters and the second helps decide which of the sensors will sleep. Together they improve the lifetime of the clusters. Biologically inspired activator-inhibitor mechanism is employed to form clusters and select cluster heads based on the activator concentration where each sensor is associated with a pair of activator and inhibitor concentration values. In each cluster, a Gür game is applied to determine the set of active sensor nodes while inactive sensor nodes turn to sleep mode for conserving energy. The activator–inhibitor system is known to provide the mechanism for autonomous biological pattern formation, such as spots on mammals’ coats, through interactions between molecules and their diffusion rates. The Gür game is a self-organized artificial game associating voters in the game with finite state automata and a moderator with a reward function. Typically in wireless sensor networks, the base station is considered as the moderator and sensor nodes as voters in the Gür game. To further maximize the lifetime of the network, in our proposed routing algorithm, each cluster is then associated with a Gür game to determine the number of active sensor nodes where the cluster head is regarded as the moderator and the cluster members as voters.

The main goal of this work is to prove the efficiency of the Khalimpsky topology combined with a mobile agents architecture on the captured images rooting in terms of the energy saving and network lifetime prolongation. The Khalimsky intra-cluster shortest paths are calculated by using the triangulation approach around a selected anchor nodes. These obtained paths are concatenated to form the inter-cluster way between the cluster-heads and the sink. We prove that the traffic distribution across the Khalimsky paths allows load balancing between deployed sensor nodes and minimizes the energy consumption. We prove also that the used multi-agents architecture optimizes the management of captured images and minimizes the number of exhausted nodes.

A Novel Energy-Efficient and Distance-Based Clustering Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00930-8_16,11,conference,Springer,none,"Hierarchical architecture is an effective mechanism to make the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) scalable and energy-efficient. Clustering the sensor nodes is a famous two-layered architecture which is suitable for WSNs and has been extensively explored for different purposes and applications. In this paper, a novel clustering approach called the Energy-Efficient Distance-based Clustering (EEDC) protocol is proposed for WSNs. Selecting the cluster heads in the proposed EEDC is performed based on a hybrid of residual energy and the distances among the cluster-heads. At first, the nodes with the most residual energy are elected and form an initial set of cluster-head candidates. Then the candidates with a suitable distance to other neighbour candidates are elected as the cluster-heads. The proposed algorithm is fast with a low time complexity. The proposed EEDC offers a long lifetime for the network, and at the same time, a proper level of fault tolerance. Different simulation experiments are done on different states and the algorithm is compared to some well-known clustering approaches.

Dynamic TDMA Scheduling for Topology Controlled Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1084-7_17,none,conference,Springer,none,"


The need for interconnection among multiple sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) leads to a higher collision rate and correlated contention based on the incremental node participation in the network. Limited power resources and variation in the topological structures are the major constraints for centralized timeslot assigning algorithm. Though the topology variation gets addressed by distributed timeslot management algorithm, they fail to reduce the energy depletion. Incorporation of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) for scheduling the slot is found to eliminate the collision by guaranteeing the energy conservation. Efficient distribution of TDMA slots to minimize the energy and topology factors has been addressed by several algorithms. In this paper, a technique for energy minimization is proposed for controlling the topology of the WSN. We propose a dynamic TDMA scheduling and integrate within TL-LEACH protocol.

Cluster-Based Wireless Sensor Networks Using Ant Colony Optimization,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03146-6_5,5,conference,Springer,none,"
Nodes in the Wireless sensor network (WSN) have the limited power, memory and battery capacity. In this work, we propose an efficient routing algorithm called Cluster Based Wireless Sensor Network using Ant Colony Optimization (CBACO). The Cluster Heads (CH) are selected based on the cost derived from node parameters remaining energy, number of neighbours and distance to base station. The weighted average method is used to compute cost. The routing processes are established in two levels. The cluster member to cluster head data transmission is handled at level one and in the second level path finding process between cluster head to base station handled by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method which is the biologically inspired optimization technique. All the cluster head nodes are participate in the second level inter-cluster routing operation. The performance of the CBACO algorithm in terms of delay is minimized by using the clustering method and ACO method. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is analysed by compare with existing routing algorithm which uses LEACH and ACO method. The results indicate that our proposed work achieves low energy consumption and high throughput.

Data fusion is the process of combining data from several sources to produce a single scenario.

Computational intelligence (CI) principles like localization, grouping, power-sensitive routing, job arrangement, and protection are now widely employed WSNs & other applications. WSNs are organized into clusters to optimize data-collecting efficiency while minimizing energy dissipation. Clustering allows you to organize a deployed network into a connected hierarchy while simultaneously balancing network load and increasing the system's lifespan. Each sensor node in a cluster-based WSN sends the data it has acquired to the cluster coordinator for the cluster in which it is located. The expanse among cluster heads & events, with the energy of clusters, is fuzzified in order to choose clusters for data uploading and fusing using fuzzy logic. The cluster heads apply the fugitive logic technique in confined resolution building as well, and the outcomes of the local decision-making are then relayed to the base station.

Hierarchical Clustering Routing Protocol Based on Optimal Load Balancing in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45293-2_17,1,conference,Springer,none,"Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in different aspects of human life such as agriculture, health care systems, traffic engineering and so on. By improving WSN’s design and applicability, still due to energy limitation in the sensors, the main concern is about the lifetime of sensors. Beside hardware aspect, establishing some efficient techniques for data sensing, processing and transition in the sensors can increase WSN’s lifetime. In this paper, a new optimized routing protocolcalled OLBHC (Optimal Load Balancing Hierarchical Clustering) is designed. In contrast to some traditional methods such as LEACH, OLBHC could decrease the energy consumption in the sensors by utilizing the equalization method. In OLBHC, a Flag matrix which stores cluster head nodes’ connection status is used and then an optimization algorithm is applied for selecting the best clusters in the network based on the energy consumption. The simulation results prove this proposed approach’s efficiency because by applying OLBHC the average lifetime of nodes is about 160% longer than LEACH and almost all of the nodes are dead in LEACH when the first node begins to die in OLBHC.",2013,Advanced Parallel Processing Technologies,"Tianshu Wang,Gongxuan Zhang,Xichen Yang,Ahmadreza Vajdi","(Department of Computer Science,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,210094,China)",China

Optimal Cluster Head Rotation for Heterogeneous WSNs,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-44038-1_86,1,conference,Springer,none,"
Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an essential part of the Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs are composed of battery powered devices with limited processing capabilities in terms of CPU, memory and transmission range. As opposed to homogeneous WSNs where nodes are all equal, heterogeneous ones are composed of nodes that can have different initial energy, different transmission rate and different transmission range. Since devices are battery powered gathering data in an energy efficient way is essential. Clustering is one of the approaches that has been proposed by the research community in order to collect data in an energy efficient way. That requires to organise the WSN into various sets that are clusters. Each cluster has a representative node that is the cluster head (CH). This gathers data from the cluster members and forwards them to the BS. Beside clustering, the rotation of the CH role is a standard means to better distribute energy consumption. In this paper we propose an Optimum Rotation Scheduling (ORS) that is based on Integer Programming. We assume the WSN has been already clustered by using some clustering scheme. We then apply to each cluster a novel Integer Linear Programming formulation in order to define a cluster rotation that produces the optimum cluster lifetime.",31 March 2020,"Web, Artificial Intelligence and Network Applications","Renato De Leone,Leonardo Mostarda","(Department of Mathematics,University of Camerino,Camerino,Italy),(Department of Computer Science,University of Camerino,Camerino,Italy)","Italy,Italy"

These nodes are equipped with constrained resource batteries. Due to its distributed nature, WSNs offer ease of access to small detecting nodes to sense the surrounding information. WSNs use the multi-hop communication technique to transmit the data to the node which is far away from its communication range through the neighbor nodes. Various WSN applications are, forest driving, underwater, and sometimes mountain-based, so it is not possible to recharge or reinstate these batteries throughout the assignment. Hence, efficient energy utilization is a significant challenge in these types of networks, as the node energy, as well as the buffer, is constrained. Thus, these available resources of the node must be utilized efficiently for various basic functions as data sensing, processing the sensed data, and transmitting processed information. So, the direction-finding protocols are one of the key considerable factors to reduce the consumption of energy and lifetime elaboration of the network. In WSNs Cluster-based routing is a prevalent method to achieve network performance with energy efficiency to enhance the network lifetime.

The most prevalent infrastructure for these applications is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Although WSNs have intriguing characteristics, the security of such networks is a major concern, especially for applications where confidentiality is extremely crucial. In order to set up WSNs securely, any type of intrusion should be identified before attackers potentially harm the network. However, research findings have demonstrated that existing approaches are ineffective, particularly in detecting attacks in real-time, mostly owing to the accumulation of enormous amounts of data through interconnected devices. Within this interpretation, our intention is to construct a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for analyzing real-time network traffic of WSNs using online learning algorithm while taking into account the network’s resource constraints. To achieve this goal, we investigated the use of an online classifier, namely the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT), along with the selection of relevant attributes to distinguish four kinds of DoS attacks among normal network traffic: the attacks considered are Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling attacks.

The efficient energy consumption in wireless sensor network is a critical issue since the energy in the nodes is constrained resource. In this paper, we present a transmission relay method of communications between BS (Base Station) and CHs (Cluster Heads) for balancing the energy consumption and extending the average lifetime of sensor nodes by the fuzzy logic application. The proposed method is designed based on LEACH protocol. The area deployed by sensor nodes is divided into two groups based on distance from BS to the nodes. RCH (Relay Cluster Head) relays transmissions from CH to BS if the CH is in the area far away from BS in order to reduce the energy consumption. RCH decides whether to relay the transmissions based on the threshold distance value that is obtained as a output of fuzzy logic system.

In this paper, we present a geometric and the transitional probability for the cluster head selection in wireless sensor networks. Therefore, a continuous semi-Markov chain-based node behavior prediction process is incorporated for identifying the trust parameter that integrates the energy factor estimated previously based on fuzzy probability. The proposed algorithm is the fuzzy-based geometric translational probability (FGTP) for cluster head selection. The semi-Markov chain is implemented by using fuzzy logic for determining the cluster head selection process. The implementation of the proposed FGTCH scheme is investigated based on various performance metrics such as the Packet delivery ratio, Delay, Energy difference, Throughput and quantified trust. The trust parameter is incorporated in the proposed FGTCH scheme for optimizing the cluster head selection through soft computing techniques. To evaluate the proposed FGTCH model, extensive simulations were carried out in MATLAB. The number of nodes in a network ranges from 70 to 100 nodes. The simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed FGTCH, and it is compared with existing LEACH for clusters head formation, the average end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and lifetime computation. When the number of nodes is 30, the percentage of average end-to-end delay (s) of cluster formation using fuzzy-based geometric translational probability for cluster head selection algorithm is decreased by 4.87% than LEACH.

Impact of Sink Location in the Routing of Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1384-8_6,none,conference,Springer,none,"
Wireless sensor networks is a collection of many low power sensing devices having local processing and wireless communication capabilities. In these wireless networks, energy constraint is significant. To provide communication between sensor devices, many routing protocols have been proposed. In each routing protocol, their main task is to transmit data (via single hop or multi-hop) towards the sink. Hence, location of the sink has a vital impact on the various factors like performance of the routing protocol. As sink can be static and mobile, but in many applications, sink mobility is not possible. In this paper, we examine the performance of extanttree and clustered based routing WSN protocol, when the different location of a static sink (i.e., at centre, corner and far) is deployed. We perform analytical simulation in terms of networks lifetime. We test the existing network based routing algorithm (i.e. HEEMP, CAMP, GSTEB, TBC, PEGASIS, LEACH) extensively. For each routing algorithm we have evaluated the impact of sink locality. The experimental results show that the HEEMP, CAMP algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms.

Depending on the order in which the formation of clusters and the election of cluster leaders are performed, these protocols can be subdivided into two categories: the Leader-First (LF) and the Cluster-First (CF) approaches. In LF approaches, clusterheads are first elected according to certain metrics (e.g., degree of connectivity, remaining energy), and then agree to assign the other nodes to different clusters. While in CF techniques, all sensors first form clusters, and then each cluster chooses its leader. In previous work, we proposed LQI-DCP, which is a non-secure distributed protocol for multihop clustering with an LF approach.

It needs simple and effective network organization to improve the network lifetime in building practical wireless sensor networks (WSNs). As we know, clustering is a classical network model and has been widely used in WSNs, where cluster head (CH) is a manager to control its members and collect sensed data from them. However, in the most of the existing work, the number of cluster heads is stabilized so that the distribution of cluster heads is not reasonable. In addition, they did not consider the dynamic cooperative aware storage and transmission of the sensed data. Therefore, we propose an efficient cluster head selected approach for multimode sensors. First, we select the optimal number of cluster heads based on the approximate distance from the nodes to the sink and the network side length. Second, the nodes that are deployed in the range of cluster head competition radius broadcast their ID, residual energy, location information and distance to the sink node. In the proposed approach, each node competes cluster head according to the number of adjacent nodes and the distance to the sink.

But the energy restrictions of the nodes have the impact in use of the network in many fields. The extant cluster-based energy-efficient routing consumes large amount of energy from the cluster head since the cluster head is also a node in the network. This tends to failure of the node sooner, and the number of clusters on the network is not predicted that makes complexity of the system model. Hence, this article brings the reference node to make the manual cluster on the network, which reduces the energy consumed by the cluster head as in other models. The reference node finds the number of path available for the mobile node to transmit the data by considering the congestion and retransmission, which allows the node to lose its energy. Then black widow optimized routing protocol finds the optimal path to transmit the data with received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The parameters of the model are analyzed against the extant protocols. The energy consumed in the network is 60 J for 4000 rounds; at the same time none of the node is dead, and a total of 50 mobile nodes are alive on the network by inhibiting the throughput of 99.23%, which is not happened on the state-of-the-art models.",02 April 2024,Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Advances in Computational Intelligence,"J.

QoS needs vary from application to application. In order to keep tabs on and gather data on the physical state of a given area, a typical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) utilizes a combination of sensing technology. There might be either physical or logical communications between nodes. The military, business, and health sectors, as well as the environmental and urban sectors, can all benefit from WSNs because of the low-cost and rapidly deployable solutions they provide. WSNs are expected to play a significant role in the sensing of a wide variety of applications in the near future. Safe data transmission via a WSN network is a major difficulty. This is because WSNs are frequently used in unsupervised or even hostile settings. In recent years, routing approaches have mostly focused on metrics like trust, resilience, energy preservation, etc. However, other security solutions have lately emerged, taking into account the security challenges in WSNs as well. Since wireless sensors applications are becoming increasingly popular, QoS has emerged as a critical concern. The available resources of sensors and the numerous applications running across these networks have varied limits in their nature and requirements, making it tough and challenging to guarantee quality of service in WSNs.

In this paper, we present a shortest path routing algorithm based on Chandy-Misra’s distributed shortest path algorithm regarding both node weight and edge weight. X percent of edge’s weight and (100 - X) percent of node’s weight form a total cost between neighbor and source node which is used in order to generate the shortest paths and construct a spanning tree. Variation of X percent, node weight and edge weight provide resilience for shaping needed paths and change the spanning tree’s structure. When at least one node is close to critical energy level or a fault occurs, the routing algorithm is re-executed and new paths are generated.

Therefore, protecting such networks from attacks is a major challenge. We propose a scheme where sink, the resource-rich node, keeps track of attack threat based on statistics of network traffic. If any threat is apprehended, the sink and nodes together start analysis on each node’s contribution towards the network traffic to confirm the attack (if any) and identify the attacked node. Unlike existing attack prevention scheme, which incorporates securing mechanism starting from the network in operation, the present scheme starts secure communication only when it detects attack thereby reducing securing overheads significantly. As there is energy constraint in WSN, the main objective of this work is to reduce energy consumption while keeping the network secured. The other objective is to reduce attack detection time concomitantly so that the network can start secure communication before the attack causes any significant damage in the network. Performance of the scheme is compared with one of the state-of-the-art scheme.

An Application of Firefly Algorithm for Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-2638-3_98,5,conference,Springer,none,"Wireless sensor network gained popularity during the past few decades due to the ad hoc nature, which makes it easy to install in a landscape where human may not be able to approach. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is considered for networks consisting of many tiny sensor devices running on batteries. This type of wireless sensor networks are deployed to fulfil a specific objective for a long period of time, hence the energy consumed in communication should be optimized to prolong the network. This paper presents the energy optimization method using Firefly algorithm to prolong network lifetime. Firefly algorithm is a nature inspired optimization technique that is based on the behaviour of an insect known as “Firefly” that produces the flashing light mainly to attract the pray and to attract the mating partner. The proposed algorithm for effective communication is compared with LEACH and ABC (Artificial Bee Colony) optimization for cluster-based sensor network and the simulated result shows the better performance.

When the sensors are deployed in some remote areas, it becomes cumbersome to provide energy resources for their continual operations in IoT-based WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Therefore, the main concern in such a network is the network longevity which is predominantly achieved by the energy-efficient routing techniques. Therefore, to resolve the above-said concern, in this paper, the cluster-based routing is considered that selects double Cluster Heads (CHs) in each cluster against the single CH in the conventional routing methods. While doing so, the data dissemination from the cluster members is done by the Primary CH (PCH), whereas the Secondary CH (SCH) helps in forwarding data to the next SCH after collecting it from PCH of its cluster. The multi-hop routing is followed and the nodes are of two-level energy heterogeneous in their configuration. The selection of PCH and SCH is done based on the residual energy, distance and node density. The proposed technique is named as EEDCH (Energy-Efficient Dual CH). It is observed that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art protocols comprehensively, in terms of different performance metrics namely, stability period, network lifetime and network remaining energy.

The wireless systems that are battery-driven can easily reconfigure the existing devices and sensors efficiently in the manufacturing units without employing any cable for power operation as well as for communication. The wireless sensor–actuator networks that are based on IEEE 802.15.4 consume significantly less power. These networks are designed and built cost-effectively by considering the capacity of battery and expense so that they can be employed for many applications. The application of a typical wireless autonomous scheduling and distributed graph routing algorithm (ASDGRA) has illustrated the reliability of employing its basic approaches for almost ten years, and it consists of the accurate plot for routing and time-slotted channel hopping therefore ensuring accurate low-power wireless communication in the processing site and officially declared by the controversial statements associated with the government of Greek experiences fourth industrialization. There is a huge requirement for sensor nodes to link via WSAN in the industrial site. Also, reduced computational complexity is one of the drawbacks faced by the existing standards of WSAN which is caused because of their highly centralized traffic management systems and thereby significantly improves the consistency and accessibility of network operations at the expense of optimization. This research work enables the study of efficient wireless DGR network management and also introduces an alternative for ASDGRA by enabling the sensor nodes to determine their data traffic routes for the transmission of data. When compared to the above two physical routing protocols, the proposed technique can drastically improve the performance of a network, throughput, and energy consumption under various aspects. Energy harvesting (EH) plays a significant role in the implementation of large sensor devices. The requirement for subsequent employment of power sources is eliminated by the efficient approach of energy harvesting and thereby providing a relatively close- perpetual working environment for the network.

This network is generally used to collect and process data from different regions where the movement of human being are unusual in modern age. The sensor nodes are deployed in such position where fixed network is not being present. That location may be very remote or some disaster-prone area. In disaster-prone zone, after disaster, most often no fixed network remains active. In that scenario, one of the reliable sources to collect the data is the ad-hoc sensor network. As sensor nodes are very much battery hunger, an efficient power utilization is required for enhancing the network-lifetime by reducing data traffic in the WSN. For this reason, it is important to develop very efficient software and hardware solutions as well as managing different topological aspects to make the most efficient use of limited resources in terms of energy, computation and storage. One of the most suitable approaches is data aggregation protocol which can reduce the communication cost by extending the lifetime of sensor networks. The process on cost reduction of WSN techniques are developing in different aspects like intelligent cluster based and tree based approaches. These are used for most suitable data aggregation techniques. In this concern, many different approaches also be used for cluster formation and collecting data from different sensor nodes.

To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic backup CH selection method that doesn’t need global topology knowl- edge or extra nodes in the network. In case of CH failures this backup CH undertakes the CH’s role and recovers cluster immediately. Secondly, we introduce a dynamic load balancing method to prevent overloading of CHs in network.

This decreases the loads of overloaded CHs and increases the lifetime of that cluster.

Prolonging the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network Via Multihop Clustering,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11759355_13,6,conference,Springer,none,"Wireless nodes in sensor network detect surrounding events and then deliver the sensed information to a base station. Organizing these sensors into clusters enables efficient utilization of the limited network resources. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed such as LEACH, HEED, GAF and so on. While LEACH has many excellent features such as highly adaptive, self-configuring cluster formation, application-specific data aggregation, etc., it does not scale well when the network size or coverage increases. In this paper, the Enhanced Multihop Clustering Algorithm (EMCA) is proposed which utilizes multihop links for both intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication. To model the energy consumption more accurately, each cluster is modeled as a Voronoi Cell instead of a circle. The optimal parameter values are determined to minimize the total energy consumption so as to prolonging the lifetime of the whole network. Numerical results show that when both LEACH and EMCA operate with optimal parameter values, the total energy consumption of EMCA is much smaller than that of LEACH.

The capabilities of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can be extended using self-organization to change their behavior dynamically and achieve network wide characteristics. Clustering techniques show the self-organized behavior of WSNs. Sensor nodes are grouped into disjoint, nonoverlapping subsets called clusters. Cluster Heads (CHs) collect data from the sensor nodes present in the cluster and forward it to the neighboring nodes using shortest path distance calculation and finally to the Base Station (BS). In the proposed clustering technique, network area is divided into regions. Cluster Head (CH) is elected by using the highest residual energy and the node degree. Cluster communication is at the most two-hop which results in less number of messages from member nodes to BS. Within a cluster, data is sent to CH by member nodes. After some time CH’s energy level goes below threshold value, then new CH is elected and clusters are reformed within each region.

WSN can alter progressively as a result of extrinsic or intrinsic factors, necessitating a devaluing valueless network overhaul. Traditional WSN methods are directly coded, making it difficult for networks to adapt continuously. Machine learning methodologies may be used to respond appropriately in such situations. Machine Learning is the method of a machine learning system learning from its observations and acting without the need for human interaction or reprogramming. A study of machine learning methods for WSNs is provided, spanning the years 2014 to 2019. We showcased numerous ML-based methodologies for WSNs in this study, along with their benefits, disadvantages, and variables that affect network lifetime. ML methodologies for synchronization, obstruction management, mobile sink planning, and power generation are also discussed. Eventually, we provide a methodological overview of the sample, as well as the explanations for using a specific ML methodology to solve a problem in WSNs and a summary of the remaining problems. The application of certain machine learning methodologies has been explained through the scenario of identifying anomalies in the medical WSN. The dataset utilized in this scenario is in real-time and obtained from Physionet.",22 November 2021,Proceedings of Data Analytics and Management,"Shivani G. Dharmale,Snehal A.

Hierarchical Workflow Management in Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32695-0_53,3,conference,Springer,none,"To build the service-oriented applications in a wireless sensor network (WSN), the workflow can be utilized to compose a set of atomic services and execute the corresponding pre-designed processes. In general, WSN applications rely closely on the sensor data which are usually inaccurate or even incomplete in the resource-constrained WSN. Then, the erroneous sensor data will affect the execution of atomic services and furthermore the workflows, which form an important part in the bottom-to-up dynamics of WSN applications. In order to alleviate this issue, it is necessary to manage the workflow hierarchically. However, the hierarchical workflow management remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, by adopting the Bloom filter as an effective connection between the sensor node layer and the upper application layer, a hierarchical workflow management approach is proposed to ensure the QoS of workflow-based WSN application . The case study and experimental evaluations demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach.",2012,PRICAI 2012: Trends in Artificial Intelligence,"Endong Tong,Wenjia Niu,Hui Tang,Ding Tang,Song Ci,Gang Li,Song Ci","(High Performance Network Laboratory,Institute of Acoustics,Chinese Academy of Science,Beijing,China,100190),(School of Information Technology,Deakin University,221 Burwood Highway,Vic,3125,Australia),(University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Omaha,NE,68182,USA)",Australia

A Trust-Based Mechanism to Improve Security of Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-97196-0_4,1,conference,Springer,none,"The wireless sensor networks are much vulnerable to security attacks due to their dynamic nature. The trust-based mechanism offers avenues for design of efficient scheme that can improve the security of the wireless sensor network. In this research work, a trust calculation scheme has been proposed which is based on the packet delivery ratio (PDR). The trust represents the reputation of a wireless sensor node. The packet delivery ratio is calculated based on the number of packets received divided by the total number of packets transmitted. The threshold value of PDR is defined and the node whose trust is below the threshold value will be a target as the least trusted node. The trust is calculated directly and indirectly also trust values will be updated from time to time. The proposed trust model has been implemented in NS2 and results were analysed in terms of network throughput, packet loss, and average energy consumption. The results of the trust-based scheme have shown considerable improvement as compared to the shield-based scheme. It was concluded from the results that the proposed technique detects malicious nodes early as compared to shield based technique. Further, the proposed security scheme increases the throughput of the network and packet loss, energy consumption is reduced as compared to the shield-based scheme in a wireless sensor network.",24 March 2022,Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Vision and Computing (ICIVC 2021),"Sangeeta Rani,Dinesh Kumar,Vikram Singh","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,University College of Engineering and Technology,Guru Kashi University,Talwandi Sabo,Punjab,India),(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Chaudhary Devi Lal University,Sirsa,India)","India,India"
Trust-Aware Clustering Approach Using Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0111-1_27,2,conference,Springer,none,"Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) are a definitive area for applications such as basic security activities, military reconnaissance and observing forest fire. In MWSNs appropriate selection of cluster head (CH) is to enhance the network lifetime. On taking the security of network into account is a challenging task. Trustworthy data collection is a major topic that interests much research work. Trust plays an important role in military and other applications. Many algorithms do not take security into account while selecting CH for MWSNs. Existing security-aware protocols use the cryptographic method, which are not enough to overcome serious issues. The cryptographic technique causes complexity in the network, a large amount of overhead and poor connectivity. Therefore, this paper proposes a trust-aware approach for MWSNs using type-2 fuzzy logic (T2FL). Trust value is considered as a major parameter that affects the performance of nodes. In this approach, to elect secure CH, trust value, remaining battery power, concentration, distance to base station and moving speed is used. Experimental analysis shows that this approach can successfully eliminate the malicious node in MWSN.",17 September 2019,Advanced Informatics for Computing Research,"Asra Kousar,Nitin Mittal,Prabhjot Singh","(Electronics and Communication Engineering,Chandigarh University,Mohali,Punjab,140413,India)",India
