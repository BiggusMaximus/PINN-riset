Energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is of a primary concern due to the limited energy capacity of sensor nodes. Since most power dissipation occurs in wireless communication, it becomes imperative to reduce the energy costs of communication by developing power efficient communication protocols. To that end, this paper presents scaling hierarchical power efficient clustering with energy aware routing (SHEAR), which offers a clustering based scalable topology control coupled with an energy aware path selection scheme. By selecting cluster heads based on the maximum local residual energy of neighboring nodes, the topology control of SHEAR distributes energy dissipation evenly among all clusters. Additionally, routes for packet flows are allocated such that the aggregate energy consumption along a chosen path is minimized while avoiding the nodes with low energy levels. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHEAR in attaining reasonably long-lived WSNs.",12 December 2015,Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling,"Mumtaz Ali Shah,Ghulam Abbas,Zahid Halim,Abdul Basit Dogar","(Faculty of Computer Sciences & Engineering,GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology,Topi,23640,Pakistan),(Department of Computer Science and Technology,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China)","China,Pakistan"

Such grouping of nodes helps immensely to elongate the life of Wireless Sensor Networks. Message exchanges between nodes for consecutive and periodic clustering overload the sensor nodes and cause a shortfall of energy. Additional overhead during cluster formation, instability in energy use and the difficulty of information sharing during clustering, uncertain network structure, etc. are the current clustering problems. There is also a need to enhance intra-cluster transmission and to find effective methods to extend the network's lifespan. This paper aims to reduce the energy loss of nodes by reducing the message transmission overhead and simplifying the creation and upgrading of clusters to improve the lifespan of the network. A clustering strategy where the cluster is regularly restructured to decrease the overhead on cluster head nodes is also proposed in the paper. The suggested approach reduces data transmission using machine learning by the cluster member nodes and reduces the energy consumption of individual sensor nodes by implementing a suitable active/sleep schedule. To calculate the cluster update cycle and sleep cycle, it also makes use of the advantages of fuzzy logic by selecting appropriate fuzzy descriptors such as average data rate, distance from the head node to the sink and the remaining energy.

This leads to early depletion of their energy reserves and potentially causing the network to partition creating hot spots or energy holes. Effective clustering algorithms are needed to mitigate these hot spots.

The deployment of these nodes or sensors takes place randomly in the dynamic or static environment. This type of placement of nodes in a hostile environment can be charged by the malicious nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN). This vulnerability in nodes makes the wireless sensor network unstable and leads to many types of demerits like limited battery lifetime, less computing and limited memory space. To avoid these attacks and to reduce the impact created by the malicious nodes, we suggest a simple and effective way of detecting and removing unhealthy nodes in the environment. We proposed a simple scheme by using the artificial bee colony algorithm which is known as the soldier bee defence mechanism to provide proper security from the impersonate of node attack algorithm in detecting the malicious node present in the network. The malicious nodes will be intimated to the base station and the changes in the position of the estimated node should be monitored continuously. To develop an enriched swarm intelligence algorithm-based secured artificial bee colony optimizer gives a global exploration of multiple paths for carrying data transmission from the sensor to sink nodes in the absence of malicious nodes. Here, we are using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for secured communication between the nodes in a wireless network. The novelty of this algorithm is to detect a compromised node and to reduce the authentication delay and packet loss. The theme of a scheme is to find the unhealthy or malicious cluster head nodes in the network and removing that particular node without creating any harm to the other nodes in the environment.

A sink mobility path is developed over the networking region once partitioned into the ideal number of groupings. The GA procedure chooses the best sink positions for every cluster’s path. The movable sink collects information from every node within the associated clusters when it stops at the ideal sink positions. When transmitting information, a good sink position uses the least amount of node power. The GA initializes the community of chromosomes to find the best sink position for groups. Additionally, a network-based energy usage framework is suggested that carries out the GA procedure’ fitness assessing operator.

Hierarchical clustering and routing protocol to ensure scalability and reliability in large-scale wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-021-03671-1,26,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency,Clustering,Antlion optimizer,Data reliability","Cluster-based routing protocols have been proven efficient in prolonging the life cycle of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Periodic and multi-hop clustering are the most popular techniques which provide the required energy-efficient communication and scalability in large-scale WSNs. In clustering, WSN is divided into number of clusters, and cluster head is selected in each cluster. However, in the existing clustering protocols, CH’s near base station undergoes large number of receiving, aggregating and transmitting operations in comparison with far away CHs. This imbalance of load on CHs and lack of structured multi-level clustering framework leads to early death of WSNs. Moreover, resolving the issues of scalability and data reliability along with load balancing is a very tedious task. In this paper, a hierarchical clustering and routing (HCR) protocol is proposed to formulate a load-balanced approach for clustering while taking care of energy efficiency, reliability and scalability. Firstly, a hierarchical layered framework is created to split the WSN into virtual circular layers for efficient transmission of data in hierarchical fashion. Subsequently, an ant lion optimizer is employed for the selection of CHs to ensure reliable, energy balanced and scalable cluster formation. Simulation results demonstrate that HCR protocol outperforms existing state-of-the-art clustering protocols in terms of network lifetime, balanced clustering, throughput and energy efficiency.

HCM: a hierarchical clustering framework with MOORA based cluster head selection approach for energy efficient wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00542-023-05508-8,2,article,Springer,none,"Energy-efficient operation is one of the prime goals of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) because of the limited battery capacity and the harshness of the environment they are deployed in. Clustering techniques with multihop communication is one such technique that is suitable to achieve this goal. These approaches suffer from load balancing and hotspot issues because of the uneven energy consumption between cluster head (CH) nodes and member nodes (MNs). The Hierarchical Layer Balanced Clustering (HLBC) approach is a clustering framework that is highly effective in comparison to the current state of the art in addressing such issues. This work aims to optimize the process of CH selection and reduce intra-cluster communication distance (IACD) in the context of HLBC. For this purpose, Multi-Objective Optimization based on Ratio Analysis (MOORA) has been employed by considering three critical attributes, viz., residual energy, node centrality, and distance to relay, along with a Shannon entropy-based attribute weighting scheme for CH selection. The modified Dijkstra-based minimum spanning tree formation technique based on energy left, load, and distance to the relay node has been presented to reduce IACD and to distribute the load on MNs evenly. The proposed HCM scheme has been analyzed corresponding to two network scenarios, each for a homogeneous and heterogeneous network, based on three performance measures: node death rate, energy consumption, and network lifetime.

A load of sensor node and its distance from base station (BS) are the significant factors of energy consumption. Therefore, load balancing according to the transmission distance is necessary for WSN. In this paper, we propose a load-balanced clustering algorithm using Fuzzy C means (FCM) algorithm and an energy-efficient routing approach using BAT-algorithm (FC-RBAT).

The use of sensors is quite wide, and in some of the places, it is very difficult or impossible to restore the energy of the sensors such as in war areas or in wildlife.

Selecting the most appropriate sensor node as cluster head (CH) according to the criteria determined within the clustered sensors reduces the energy consumption. In this study, a new clustering algorithm is proposed for WSNs to reduce energy consumption and thus prolong the life of the WSNs.

Clustering and routing techniques are widely used to balance the network load in SDN-enabled WSNs and achieve energy-efficient and stable network performance. However, one of the critical challenges in clustering is the selection of optimal control nodes (CNs). The CNs selection is challenging due to the high computational complexity during global optimization. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the CNs selection for the routing process with limited network resources. An intelligent and hybrid model of genetic mutation-based whale optimization (GM-WOA) is proposed to optimize the process of CNs selection in heterogeneous SDN-enabled WSN. In the GM-WOA approach, the self-adaptive inertia weights, fitness function and genetic mutation operation are used for dynamic CN selection and energy-efficient data transmission. The genetic mutation approach distributes CNs more evenly throughout the network to balance the network load. The GM-WOA performs at ONOS controller and simulated using ns-3 simulator.

Ensuring efficient routing entails an ever-increasing necessity for optimized energy consumption and reliable resource management of both the sensor nodes and the overall sensor network. An efficient routing solution is characterized by its ability to increase network lifetime, enhance efficiency, and ensure the appropriate quality of service. Therefore, the routing protocols need to be designed with an ultimate objective by considering and efficiently managing many characteristics and requirements, such as fault tolerance, scalability, production costs, and others.Unfortunately, many of the existing solutions lead to higher power consumption and communication control overheads, which not only increase network congestion but also decrease network lifetime. In addition, most of these protocols consider a limited number of criteria, in contrast to the complexity and the evolution of WSNs. This paper presents a new adaptive and dynamic multi-criteria routing protocol. Our protocol operates in multi-constraint environments, where most of the current solutions fail to monitor successive and continuous changes in network state and user preferences. This approach provides a routing mechanism, which creates a routing tree based on the evaluation of many criteria. These criteria can cover the topological metrics of neighboring nodes (the role of the nodes in intracommunications, connections between different parts of the network, etc.), the estimated power consumption to reach each direct neighbor, the path length (number of hops to the sink), the remaining energy of individual sensor nodes, and others. These criteria are controlled and supervised dynamically through a detection scheme. In addition, a dynamic selection mechanism, based on multi-attribute decision-making methods, is implemented to build and update the routing tree.

This proposed technique performs secured routing by encrypting the messages before they are routed to the destination through the network. In this scheme, only one pairing computation with a loop is necessary to encrypt a single message which is to be communicated to ‘n’ different receivers by forming ‘n’ different cipher texts using the proposed elliptic curve group theory based encryption algorithm. The proposed secured routing algorithm has been modeled in this work by performing the encryption of the plain text message before it is sent in the network. Moreover, this proposed system uses a trust model to check for any attempt by intermediate nodes for decrypting the encrypted messages during routing in order to enhance the security of communication. The proposed encryption scheme reduces the computation cost by computing the keys for all the receivers in one attempt. Performance analysis of this proposed scheme shows that computation time is for key formation, encryption and decryption are less in the proposed scheme when it is compared with the existing ECC based schemes for encryption and decryption.

Limiting direct communication between sensor nodes and the sink is achieved by confining sensor node’s transmission within a certain region known as clusters. Once data are being collected from all the sensors in the cluster it is sent to the sink by a node designated to communicate with the sink within a cluster. This technique not only reduces the network congestion, but it increases data reception, and conserves network energy. To achieve an increase in data received at the sink, it is necessary that the correct number of clusters are created within a sensing field. In this paper a new heuristic approach is presented to find the optimal number of clusters in a mobility supported terrestrial and underwater sensor networks. To maintain a strong association between sensor nodes and the node designated known as cluster-head (CH), it is necessary that sensor node’s mobility should also be considered during the cluster setup operation. This approach not only reduces the direct transmission between the sensor nodes and sink, but it also increases sensor node’s connectivity with its CH for the transmission of sensed data which results in the creation of a stable network structure. The proposed analytical estimate considers sensor node’s transmission range and sensing field dimensions for finding the correct number of the clusters in a sensing field.

Thus, the main motive for design and deployment of a WSN is to balance the energy consumption and, thereby maximize its network lifetime. An effective topology control scheme which helps in achieving this objective is clustering of SNs and at the same time selecting appropriate cluster heads (CHs). In this paper, we propose Fuzzy Logic-based Energy Adequate Clustering (FLEAC), a clustering protocol that makes use of fuzzy if–then rules for selecting appropriate CHs on the basis of five fuzzy descriptors, namely residual energy, average intra-cluster distance, compaction degree, packet drop probability and node history. Moreover, the proposed protocol considers selection of relay nodes (RNs) for alleviating excessive energy consumption of cluster heads. Improved grasshopper optimization algorithm is employed for the selection of appropriate relay nodes. The CHs collect data and send to the RNs that relays them to the Base station (BS). These RNs share the CHs data transmission and, thereby offload the CHs energy consumption.

Clustering of sensor nodes is a significant process that improves network lifetime and energy efficiency of WSN. Usage of equal cluster sizes in WSN causes more energy to be consumed by the cluster heads when the data is routed to sink thus resulting in hot spot problems. Hence, recent research papers focus on unequal clustering where cluster size increases as the distance to the sink increases. In this paper, cluster heads are selected by modifying energy efficient unequal clustering mechanism (EEUC). This process is done in two ways. Firstly, in EEUC, final cluster heads are selected based on the residual energy of the randomly selected tentative cluster heads. In our algorithm, tentative cluster head is selected based on energy based timer, residual energy, node IDs and trust value. Final cluster head selection approach selects final CHs based on competition range, node degree and head count. Secondly, in applications like continuous monitoring, usage of static sink causes the clusters near the sink to die out faster, as the cluster heads in these clusters form the fixed path for data routing, hence resulting in hot spot problems. In this work, an energy based cluster head selection unequal clustering algorithm (ECH-DUAL) using dual (static and mobile) sink is proposed.

The proposed algorithm, divides the Region of Interest into virtual zones, each having some designated cluster head nodes. In the entire process, a node can either be a part of a cluster or it may remain as an independent entity. A non-cluster member transmits its data to next hop node using IRP-Intelligent Routing Process (based on the trade-off between the residual energy of itself as well as its neighbor, and the required energy to transmit packets to its neighbor). If on the transmission path, some cluster member is elected as a next hop, it rejects IRP and transmits the packets to cluster head, which later forwards them to sink (adopting multihop communication among cluster heads). Routing is not solely performed using clusters, rather they aid the overall routing process, hence this protocol is named as Cluster Aided Multipath Routing (CAMP).

The QoS expected of underwater networks is effective transmission along with an extended lifespan of the network. This can be achieved with strategically placed clusters underwater which help in transmitting effectively. Clustering can be strategically used to securely transmit the data while conserving the node energy.This paper proposes an Optimal and Energy Efficient Framework for Cluster Communication Based Routing Protocol for UWCNs (OEEFCP).This scheme works in two phases. Phase-1 focuses on selecting an optimal CH (a Robust Cluster Head) which will be responsible for selecting an efficient carrier of data. Additionally, we have used probability in selecting the optimum number of clusters and CHs. Phase-2 uses an effective multipath energy model which will focus on transmitting data through effective communication channels. A RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) value is used to determine a gateway node out of the optimal CHs. The robust gateway nodes thus selected will supply data to the AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) nearest to them. The AUV nodes will then transfer the data via a communication link and thereon towards a destination on land. The proposed technique focuses on a cost effective solution for underwater transmission. The proposed OEEFCP is analyzed with existing schemes such as OC-TARE-TOPSIS and TARE-TOPSIS protocols, using the NS2 simulator. The analysis confirms that the proposed OEEFCP is capable of achieving a good performance in achieving an extended network lifespan, throughput, energy conservation and a maximized PDR.

In a typical cluster based routing protocols, few nodes are elected as cluster Head (CH) nodes and they form clusters with other nodes of the networks known as cluster members. The data sensed by cluster members is sent to CH node for data aggregation and further processing. Data Aggregation is considered to be one of the important methods used to prolong the network lifetime of WSN. Data aggregation is quite popular among cluster based routing protocols for WSN, where the data packets are aggregated by intermediate nodes till it reaches to BS. Data aggregation ultimately helps in reducing the number of data messages thereby assisting in network life prolongation. In this paper, an intra-cluster data aggregation technique (ICA) for WSNs is proposed. ICA constructs the intra cluster data aggregation path from a source node to its CH node in an energy efficient way. The data packets are aggregated along the aggregation path by intermediate relay nodes till the message reaches to designated CH node. Comparative analysis of ICA, LEACH and LEACH-C protocols are carried by considering the parameters such as number of alive nodes, energy consumption, number of data packets received by BS. Results obtained show that ICA performs better compared to LEACH and LEACH-C protocols.",27 January 2020,International Journal of Information Technology,"Anupkumar M. Bongale,C. R.

Finding routes in these networks is expensive in terms of energy consumption and requires more computing power within each node. This has encouraged deploying software-defined paradigms in WSNs because the integration of software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN) employs a control server and multiple Control Nodes (CNs). A base station computes routes termed a control server, and CNs are selected amongst the Sensor Nodes (SNs). Selecting an optimal CN is a challenging problem in SDWSN. So, this paper explored an energy-efficient multi-objective meta-heuristic-based routing algorithm for determining optimal nodes as CNs.

In addition, some of these frameworks generate a significant volume of IDS traffic, which can cause congestion in bandwidth constrained WSNs. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by proposing a game theory based multi layered intrusion detection framework for WSNs. The proposed framework uses a combination of specification rules and a lightweight neural network based anomaly detection module to identify the malicious sensor nodes. Additionally, the framework models the interaction between the IDS and the sensor node being monitored as a two player non-cooperative Bayesian game. This allows the IDS to adopt probabilistic monitoring strategies based on the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium of the game and thereby, reduce the volume of IDS traffic introduced into the sensor network. The framework also proposes two different reputation update and expulsion mechanisms to enforce cooperation and discourage malicious behavior among monitoring nodes. These mechanisms are based on two different methodologies namely, Shapley Value and Vickery–Clark–Grooves (VCG) mechanism. The complexity analysis of the proposed reputation update and expulsion mechanisms have been carried out and are shown to be linear in terms of the input sizes of the mechanisms.

With this reason, it is highly important for an energy efficient protocol to provide good stability region with prolonged network lifetime. Secondly, a protocol should be intelligent enough to handle homogeneous as well as heterogeneous nodes efficiently in the network (i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs) because once the network executes, a homogeneous WSN is also transformed in heterogeneous WSN. This is because of different radio communication features, occurrence of random events or morphological attributes of the network field. optimized-HEED protocols are one of the most recent clustering-based algorithms which improved the various shortcomings of classical protocol, i.e., HEED and provided far efficient results in terms of energy consumption, load balancing and network lifetime. However, these demonstrated their efficiency for homogeneous WSN only. In this paper, we extend the optimized-HEED protocols for heterogeneous WSNs model on the basis of varying levels of node heterogeneity (in terms of energy), i.e., 1-level, 2-level, 3-level and multi-level, and propose these as heterogeneous optimized-HEED (Hetero-OHEED) protocols. Simulation results confirm that by increasing the level of node’s heterogeneity, stability region of each Hetero-OHEED protocol enhances extremely with prolonged network lifetime. These provide a rich solution in designing of efficient protocols for those applications, where stability region and network lifetime require equal importance.",24 April 2019,Soft Computing,"Prateek Gupta,Ajay K.

The functionalities of components inside a wireless ad hoc network depend on characteristics such as random access memory capacity, battery life, and storage capacity. Several factors such as lack of protection, insufficient infrastructure, ease of construction, proximity to war zones, and absence of security measures make the buildings susceptible to various risks. The rising frequency of network attacks has greatly affected various characteristics like energy consumption, packet loss, latency, throughput, and uptime. Intrusion detection systems and other conventional security measures may not offer an adequate guarantee of the consistency of the system that they are protective of.

Though energy harvesting technologies are improving, the energy of sensors remains a scarce resource when designing routing protocols between sensor nodes and base station. This paper proposes a multi-hop graph-based approach for an energy-efficient routing (MH-GEER) protocol in wireless sensor networks which aims to distribute energy consumption between clusters at a balanced rate and thus extend networks’ lifespans. MH-GEER deals with node clustering and inter-cluster multi-hop routing selection. The clustering phase is built upon the centralized formation of clusters and the distributed selection of cluster heads similar to that of low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH). The routing phase builds a dynamic multi-hop path between cluster heads and the base station. Our strategy is about exploring the energy levels in the entire network and using these to select the next hop in a probabilistic, intelligent way. Performance evaluation shows that MH-GEER minimizes energy depletion in distant clusters and ensures load balancing in a network, thus improving the network’s lifetime and stability compared with single-hop conventional LEACH protocol.",13 October 2018,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences,"Hana Rhim,Ryma Abassi,Sihem Guemara,Karim Tamine,Damien Sauveron","(Digital Security Research Unit,Higher School of Communication of Tunis,Sup’Com,University of Carthage,Tunis,Tunisia),(MathIS,XLIM (UMR CNRS 7252/Université de Limoges),Limoges,France)","France,Tunisia"

Improving energy efficiency is a significant task in WSNs. Energy consumption is a crucial problem that affects the network lifetime due to energy limitations in sensor nodes. So, it's required to introduce more energy-efficient protocols for WSNs. Different types of energy-efficient solutions exist for WSNs. The energy consumption is optimized and controlled if clustering is an efficient data collection method. The cluster heads aggregate the data from the member nodes and transmit the aggregated data to BS (base station) either in an uncompressed or compressed manner after collecting all data by the cluster-heads (CHs). Due to the heavy inter-cluster relay and aggregation Overhead, earlier death happens to the CHs located very close to the sink. There is a need for an efficient and reliable CH selection algorithms to select reliable CHs to prevent the earlier death of CHs and frequent reselection of CHs. Therefore, in this work, a fuzzy optimal CH selection algorithm is proposed to select the optimal CHs to improve the network's lifetime. The proposed algorithm uses the following multi-objective parameters: cluster load, communication cost, neighbour density, inter and intra-cluster distance, and node energy for CH selection. The modified Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) is used in the proposed work to determine an optimal route for transmitting the data from CH to sink. The modified EPO algorithm helps to improve the multi-hop routing efficiency, reduces the cost of long-distance transmission, and decreases energy utilization during data transmission. The modified EPO considers the parameters like link quality factor, relative distance factor, and residual energy factor for relay selection. The proposed technique was compared against earlier methods like Z-DSS, CCR, RETOPSIS, and LEACH-FC. The various parameters like packet delivery ratio, lifetime, energy consumption, end-to-end delay, and Throughput are studied.

One key limitation of these sensors is the self-contained energy provided by the embedded battery due to their (tiny) size, (in) accessibility, and (low) cost constraints. Therefore, a key challenge is to efficiently control the energy consumption of the sensors, or in other words, to prolong the overall network lifetime of a large-scale sensor farm. Studies have worked toward optimizing energy in communication, and one promising approach focuses on clustering. In this approach, a cluster of sensors is formed, and its representatives, namely, a cluster head (CH) and cluster members (CMs), with the latter transmitting the sensing data within a short range to the CH. The CH then aggregates the data and forwards it to the base station (BS) using a multihop method. However, maintaining equal clustering regardless of key parameters such as distance and density potentially results in a shortened network lifetime. Thus, this study investigates the application of fuzzy logic (FL) to determine various parameters and membership functions and thereby obtain appropriate clustering criteria. We propose an FL-based clustering architecture consisting of four stages: competition radius (CR) determination, CH election, CM joining, and determination of selection criteria for the next CH (relaying). A performance analysis was conducted against state-of-the-art distributed clustering protocols, i.e., the multiobjective optimization fuzzy clustering algorithm (MOFCA), energy-efficient unequal clustering (EEUC), distributed unequal clustering using FL (DUCF), and the energy-aware unequal clustering fuzzy (EAUCF) scheme.

The proposed work is narrowed down to minimize interference in distributed homogenous WSN, ensuring that all the nodes in the network operate with the same transmission power. In this paper, an optimal shortest distance algorithm, Dynamic-Optimal Shortest Path Algorithm (DOSPA) is proposed to identify the shortest path in communication between point to point nodes. As the data traverses a number of intermediary nodes, a privileged network topology has to be built to ensure proper transmission of data. An ideal network topology is hence built dynamically for data transmission. However, a collision between data packets in interconnecting nodes is likely to occur. Furthermore, to minimize collision a non-persistent round-robin CSMA/CD algorithm is proposed. We study the network throughput, packet delay, corruption ratio by increasing the number of nodes and hence also analyzing the system in saturation state.

Optimizing routing in wireless sensor networks: leveraging pond skater and ant colony optimization algorithms,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-024-09809-6,none,article,Springer,"Mobile sink,Ant colony optimization,Routing protocol,Pond skater,Clustering,Wireless sensor network","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are crucial in collecting environmental information through sensor nodes. However, limited energy resources pose a challenge, necessitating efficient routing algorithms to minimize energy consumption. Failure to address issues can consume energy and reduce network lifespan and overall efficiency. This research paper presents a cutting-edge approach for minimizing the consumption of energy within WSN through the implementation of an optimal routing method. The approach involves two steps: first, clustering sensor nodes using the pond skater algorithm (PSA) to select cluster head (CHs) for routing; second, by leveraging the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, this study introduces an innovative technique that empowers a mobile sink to gather packets from given CHs and transmit effectively, send them back to the base station (BS). Notably, the authors make a significant contribution by introducing a different variant of the PSA algorithm to select CH. This novel approach aims to curtail the consumption of energy within WSN significantly. The authors also present an ACO-based head traversal for cluster method, resembling the traveling salesman problem coding, for minimized energy consumption. The study’s primary objectives include reducing energy consumption, minimizing packet delivery ratio, and prolonging the lifetime of the WSN. The assessment efficacy of the proposed method was achieved by regressive simulations using MATLAB on diverse scenarios.

Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) are just like WSN except either sensor nodes or sink or both can move. Similar to WSN nodes, in MWSN have limited power resources, so network life depends on battery power consumption. Most of the energy consumed by the network is when transmitting or exchange of control information and data is performed. There are different techniques presented by the researchers to conserve energy like topology control, power management, and data driven methods, etc. In this paper, an adaptive power control strategy for conserving energy in MWSN is presented. The proposed scheme uses variable transmission power to reduce energy usage in the transmission of data and control packets and estimates the energy consumed in unicast and broadcast communication of data and control packets.

The main challenge in WSNs is energy consumption. It becomes significant when a large number of nodes are deployed. Although clustering is one of the solutions to cater to this problem, but it suffers from severe energy consumption due to the non-uniform selection of CHs and frequent re-clustering. In this paper, we propose a heuristic and fuzzy based load balanced, scalable clustering algorithm for WSNs called HFLBSC. In this algorithm, we have segregated the network into a layered structure using the area under intersection over union curve. We have selected the CHs by considering residual energy and distance threshold. We have stalled the frequent re-clustering by utilizing the decision made with the help of fuzzy logic. Our proposed scheme is capable enough to elongate the network lifetime.

A two-step clustering to minimize redundant transmission in wireless sensor network using sleep-awake mechanism,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-021-02885-8,11,article,Springer,"Two-step,Clustering,Redundant transmission,Sleep-awake mechanism,And wireless sensor network","This research addresses the problem of redundant data transmission and improves load-balance routing in wireless sensor network (WSN). Redundant data generates higher data transfer and additional traffic loads, which degrade the network performance. The sub-clustering approach is used to minimize redundant transmissions by grouping overlapped or closely located nodes in a cluster into several sub-clusters such that only one node is required to sense the surroundings and send data to the cluster head (CH). The remaining sub-cluster members turn off their radios to save energy. However, the grouping of nodes into non-overlapping clusters and sub-clusters as well as proper selection of nodes to be awaked within a sub-cluster remained a challenging issue. Moreover, using a single node in a cluster performing the role of CH and relay could lead to load-balancing issues as the position of the selected CH may not ensure balanced intra-cluster and inter-cluster transmissions at the same time. In this paper, we proposed a Two-Step-Clustering (TSC) to improve the performance of WSN. In TSC, in the first step, the sensor nodes of minimum distance from each other were grouped into balanced non-overlapping clusters and sub-clusters. Then, a sleep-awake mechanism was employed among the members of the sub-cluster such that the sub-cluster members take turns according to their remaining energy. This is done to minimize redundant transmission to achieve energy efficiency. Furthermore, two CHs were selected, i.e., primary, and secondary CHs. The primary CH is responsible for intra-cluster data collection and the secondary CH is responsible for inter-cluster data transmission. This improves load-balanced routing within the network. In addition, single-hop and multi-hop routing were used to send data to BS. The result shows that the TSC has 54% lifetime improvements against SEED and 60% against DHSCA.

Sensors’ energy consumption and the energy hole problem are considered as outstanding challenge of these networks. That is, since sensors use batteries with limited lifetimes and sensors which are closer to the sink transmit more data than remoter sensors, hence, they run up their energies sooner than other sensor nodes. Consequently, optimizing energy consumption is regarded as one of the most critical issues throughout a network’s operational lifetime. In this paper, by dividing a respective area into several smaller areas and using a multiple mobile sink (MS), we proposed an unequal clustering method via fuzzy logic which leads to the reduction of distances among sensors with respect to the movement direction of sink. As a result, the sizes of clusters are reduced. Accordingly, such a reduction in the sizes of clusters and the smart selection of the route by the MS eliminates energy hole issue.

The need is to minimize the global energy usage of battery-operated objects so as to reduce data transmission cost and extend the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose SEES, a scalable and energy-efficient scheme for green IoT-based heterogeneous wireless nodes. We study the impact of energy-harvesting techniques by utilizing ambient energy-harvesting relay nodes in such a way that enables a higher energy conservation and guarantees a long-lived network. SEES includes: (1) a zone-based hybrid-placement scheme, (2) a Multi-Stage Weighted Election heuristic (MSWE), and (3) a Minimum Cost Cross-layer Transmission model (MCCT).

Usually, physical characteristics of the environment including temperature, humidity, pressure etc. are examined by the sensor nodes. These nodes are generally small sized and light weight. Because of their small size, power supply is very much limited. Careful usage of the limited power supply is a very important factor to be considered during communication of data in the network. With the aim of achieving effective energy usage, several techniques have been applied for the routing of information packets. One such technique is clustering of sensor nodes within the network. It implicates that the nodes organize themselves into groups to form several clusters where each group has a leader of the cluster group called the cluster head. The routing using this clustering technique does not always involve direct transmission. Rather, multi-hop transmission happens usually, with the data firstly being transferred from sensor nodes to their corresponding cluster heads and then later from cluster heads to the sink (Base Station). The cluster head is designated arbitrary or by taking into account various factors which differ according to the different routing protocols. In this paper, a new routing algorithm QBCR (Quadrangle based Clustering Routing Protocol) has been proposed which entails clustering process for routing the data to the base station. This protocol exhibits improvement over conventional routing protocols like LEACH, SEP and DEEC. In this clustering algorithm, division of the zones (clusters) based on the energy levels of the nodes has been carried out in form of quadrangle shaped clusters. The proposed protocol exhibits significant enhancement in the lifetime of the network, stability interval, rate of packet transfer (throughput), and the average energy of the network. The proposed protocol shows an improvement of atleast 50% in all parameters (lifetime of the network, stability interval, rate of packet transfer (throughput) and the average energy of the network) in comparison to the conventional protocols.

Several studies on network life time as well as data aggregation are suggested with low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) scheme which permits the part of the cluster head (CH) to be rotated amongst the sensor nodes and focuses on the distribution of energy use throughout all nodes. Life time of WSNs are impacted by the choosing of CHs; this is due to the fact that CH consumed more energy than other member nodes. In the current work, an energy effective CH election in mobile WSNs is suggested, analysed as well as evaluated based on residual energy as well as randomized election of nodes that were not designated as CHs in earlier rounds. The study proposes random competition based clustering (RCC) strategy which is more stable than the traditional clustering strategies like Lower ID (LID). IWO or Invasive Weed Optimization is a metaheuristic that has been developed recently to mimic the behaviour of the weeds. But the spatial dispersal operators and reproduction in the IWO that was originally used can make the seeds stay around the weed that is considered best that can result in convergence prematurely. In order to overcome this, EIWO or Enhanced IWO algorithm has been developed using TS or Tabu Search. Furthermore, the suggested method reveals considerable improvement in contrast to IWO LID as well as IWO-TS LID with regard to average end to end delays of sensor nodes, average packet delivery ratio of sensor nodes as well as improved network life time at the time of transmitting information.",06 November 2017,Cluster Computing,"M.

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), optimal cluster head selection and routing are two well-known optimization problems. Researchers often use hierarchal cluster-based routing, in which power consumption of cluster heads (CHs) is very high due to its extra functionalities such as receiving and aggregating the data from its member sensor nodes and transmitting the aggregated data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper care should be taken while selecting the CHs to enhance the life of the network. After formation of the clusters, data to be routed to the BS in inter-cluster fashion for further enhancing the life of WSNs. In this paper, a biogeography-based energy saving routing architecture (BERA) is proposed for CH selection and routing. The biogeography-based CH selection algorithm is proposed with an efficient encoding scheme of a habitat and by formulating a novel fitness function that uses residual energy and distance as its metrics. The BBO-based routing algorithm is also proposed. The efficient encoding scheme of a habitat is developed, and its fitness function considers the node degree in addition to residual energy and distance. To exhibit the performance of BERA, it is extensively tested with some existing routing algorithms such as DHCR, Hybrid routing, EADC and some bio-inspired algorithms, namely GA and PSO.

Multitudinous sensor nodes gather data in a self-governing manner, operating on an exhaustive source of energy or battery. Clustering process structures the network into a hierarchy wherein sensor nodes gather data passed to selected cluster head nodes which perform data processing, aggregation, and transfer it to a base station. Prolonging network lifetime and enhancing total data transmission to base station are major challenges in wireless sensor network and same is addressed in this work. A distributed energy-based epoch is used in this paper to determine node eligibility to become cluster head and a multi-parameter-weighted scalarization function is proposed to determine best cluster head candidates in order to manage dynamic and multi-characteristic node heterogeneity. The parameters used are distance to base station, expected cluster head lifetime, average cluster member node lifetime and maximum power consumed by a cluster member node. A novel weight computation strategy using analytical hierarchy process is introduced in this paper which enhances the optimality of scalarization function value. The proposed algorithm is distributed over two phases as network setup phase and clustering phase. The network setup phase computes the energy model and optimal number of cluster heads. The second phase proposes the cluster head selection process using weight-based scalarization and introduces the novel weight selection method. Finally, network operation enters the data transmission phase. The results show an enhancement in throughput at base station, with an increase of close to 30% along with an increase in the network lifetime of up to 20% as measured by last node death. The simulation results are produced in comparison with the considered base protocol of DEEC as well as other protocols using similar concepts for implementation.

Sensor nodes are dispersed over a large region and collect data from the surroundings. Data is analysed rather than sensed before being transferred via an established route to the base station (BS). Being a resource constrained network; overhead problems manifest. The energy consumption and subsequently, quick demise of nodes employed for data detection and transmission is major issue. Many other kind of network problems also arise in these constrained networks due to deadlock and livelock. Deadlock could occur if two nodes are trying to access the same data or resource simultaneously and neither can proceed until the other node releases it. This can lead to a complete halt in network operations, as nodes are unable to communicate or exchange data. The very purpose of deploying a network fails. Livelock could occur if two nodes are repeatedly sending messages to each other in response to previous messages, but none of the messages are leading to a resolution of the issue. This can lead to excessive use of network resources and can also cause a complete halt in network operations if the network becomes overloaded with traffic.

In conventional approaches, network delay and traffic rate are not mentioned during the energy aware routing process. Hence, multi-objective energy efficient Multi-objective May-Badger (M2B) optimized routing is proposed in this paper. In this proposed work, sensor nodes (SNs) are clustered, and the Cluster Head (CH) for all clusters is examined using the world cup optimization algorithm (WCO). After selecting the CH, the hybrid M2B optimization algorithm is used for the optimum routing of packets. The proposed M2B combines mayfly and honey badger optimization algorithms. The suggested protocol ensures energy efficient routing by considering several factors, such as distance between nodes, distance from the base station, node delay, and traffic rate. The proposed M2B protocol is implemented on the Network Simulation version 2 (NS2) platform, and the results are taken in terms of different performance measures. The performance measures are compared with existing approaches, and the comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in two different cases.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of spatially distributed low power sensor nodes and gateways along with sink to monitor physical or environmental conditions. In cluster-based WSNs, the Cluster Head is treated as the gateway and gateways perform the multiple activities, such as data gathering, aggregation, and transmission etc. Due to improper clustering some sensor nodes and gateways are heavily loaded and dies early. This decreases lifetime of the network. Moreover, sensor nodes and gateways are constrained by energy, processing power and memory. Hence, to design an efficient clustering is a key challenge in WSNs. To solve this problem, in this paper we proposed (1) a clustering algorithm based on the shuffled complex evolution of particle swarm optimization (SCE-PSO) (2) a novel fitness function by considering mean cluster distance, gateways load and number of heavily loaded gateways in the network.

Numerous studies on WSNs have been conducted to develop efficient algorithms that can reduce energy consumption and increase the lifetime of the entire network. In this work, the electron orbital topography algorithm is proposed for sensor deployment, which requires a smaller number of sensor nodes to cover a maximum area. In this method, the number of orbitals is estimated based on the degree of criticality of the vulnerable point. The number of sensors in each orbital is then calculated based on electron arrangement theory. After deploying a specific number of sensors in each orbital, the geographical region around the vulnerable point is divided into sectors. From each sector, a sector supervisor is elected based on the maximum residual energy of the node. Then, the cluster supervisor (CS) is selected from a set of sector supervisors located farthest from the most vulnerable point and possessing maximum residual energy. Subsequently, the virtual polygon network is formed by connecting the coordinates of the CS. The centroid of the polygon is calculated to place the sink in an optimal position from all the CS nodes.

These issues degrade the performance of the WSN; since the devices used to configure the networks are resource-constrained ones. If the protocol manages without any one of the above-said problems which will not be a complete solution for transport layer issues in WSN. Some of the data-centric applications of WSNs need the reliable transmission of data packets with reduced congestion. To addresses the same, this paper proposed the data-centric transport layer protocol (DCTP). It effectively addresses problems like reliable delivery and congestion-free transmission. One of the major problems of WSNs is cluster head (CH) election and channel assignment to the members of CH. In this paper, the modified black widow optimization is used to select the CH which leads to reduced congestion and balanced energy utilization among the nodes. In a separate phase, the reliability of the event-to-sink transmission has also been addressed. Hence this proposed DCTP will be ultimately suitable for the data-centric applications of WSNs and ensures reliability and energy efficiency (i.e., 6.2315 mJ and 7.825 mJ) in the case of varying data rate and the number of nodes.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of large amount of sensors equipped with radio frequency capabilities. In WSNs, data routing algorithms can be classified based on the network architecture into flat, direct, and hierarchal algorithms. In hierarchal (clustering) protocols, network is divided into sub-networks in which a node acts as a cluster head, while the rest behave as member nodes. It is worth mentioning that the sensor nodes have limited processing, storage, bandwidth, and energy capabilities. Hence, providing energy-efficient clustering protocol is a substantial research subject for many researchers. Among proposed cluster-based protocols, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and threshold LEACH (T-LEACH), as well as modified threshold-based cluster head replacement (MT-CHR) protocols are of a great interest as of being energy optimized. In this article, we propose two protocols to cluster a WSN through taking advantage of the shortcomings of these protocols (i.e., LEACH, T-LEACH, and MT-CHR), namely centralized density- and threshold-based cluster head replacement (C-DTB-CHR) and C-DTB-CHR with adaptive data distribution (C-DTB-CHR-ADD) protocols that mainly aim at optimizing energy through minimizing the number of re-clustering operations, precluding cluster heads nodes premature death, deactivating some nodes located at dense areas from cluster’s participation, as well as reducing long-distance communications. In particular, in C-DTB-CHR protocol, some nodes belong to dense clusters are put in the sleeping mode based on a certain node active probability, thereby reducing the communications with the cluster heads and consequently prolonging the network lifetime. Moreover, the base station is concerned about setting up the required clusters and accordingly informing sensor nodes along with their corresponding active probability. C-DTB-CHR-ADD protocol provides more energy optimization through adaptive data distribution where direct and multi-hoping communications are possible.

However, a heavy traffic load may cause the sudden death of nodes due to energy resource depletion in some network regions, i.e., hot spots that lead to network service disruption. This problem is very critical, especially for data-gathering scenarios in which Cluster Heads (CHs) are responsible for collecting and forwarding sensed data to the base station. To avoid hot spot problem, the network workload must be uniformly distributed among nodes. This is achieved by rotating the CH role among all network nodes and tuning cluster size according to CH conditions. In this paper, a clustering algorithm is proposed that selects nodes with the highest remaining energy in each region as candidate CHs, among which the best nodes shall be picked as the final CHs. In addition, to mitigate the hot spot problem, this clustering algorithm employs fuzzy logic to adjust the cluster radius of CH nodes; this is based on some local information, including distance to the base station and local density.

First, the nodes with high residual energy are selected to act as cluster head candidates (CHCs). Second, cluster heads (CHs) are selected from the CHCs based on a hybrid of competition. If the distances to the selected CHs are suitable, a CHC with more neighbor nodes and smaller average distance to its neighbor nodes is more likely to become a CH. If the number of CHs selected from the CHCs is insufficient, more CHs are selected from non-CHCs continually according to residual energy until the CHs number is suitable. DMCC makes the CHs number stable and distribute the CHs evenly. Simulation experiments were performed on to compare DMCC with some related clustering approaches.

In this paper, a centralized approach for clustering and data transmission mechanism is proposed that optimizes the power consumption and hence lifetime of the network. The mechanism is comprised of two phases. In the first phase, a mechanism based on a centralized cluster head selection that utilizes information such as nodes residual energies and their locations in the network is proposed in order to select the most appropriate candidates as cluster heads. In the second phase, the concept of a “window size” is introduced where minimization of the number of cluster head changes of a node and consequently maximization of the network lifetime is considered.

In many applications, the nodes closer to the sink are overburdened with huge traffic load as the data from the entire region are forwarded through them to reach the sink. As a result, their energy gets exhausted quickly and the network is partitioned. This is commonly known as hot spot problem. Moreover, sensor nodes are prone to failure due to several factors such as environmental hazards, battery exhaustion, hardware damage and so on. However, failure of cluster heads (CHs) in a two tire WSN is more perilous. Therefore, apart from energy efficiency, any clustering or routing algorithm has to cope with fault tolerance of CHs. In this paper, we address the hot spot problem and propose grid based clustering and routing algorithms, combinedly called GFTCRA (grid based fault tolerant clustering and routing algorithms) which takes care the failure of the CHs. The algorithms follow distributed approach. We also present a distributed run time management for all member sensor nodes of any cluster in case of failure of their CHs.

However, the minimum energy cost isn’t completely guaranteed. Therefore, in several cases, the total energy cost might be greater than direct transmission (DT). In this paper, we are interested in determining the factors that influence choosing the efficient transmission manner. It’s assumed that there is a judging metric, called characteristic distance dchar that specifies whether to use DT or MH. If the transmission distance is greater than dchar MH is used, else DT is preferred. The previous conclusion is obtained through the following three steps: The first step is to analyze the relation between the radio hardware parameters and the consumed energy of the different transmission techniques. Hence, a general law for dchar will be deduced. Secondly, a supplementary analysis will be performed to understand the effect of these parameters on dchar. Finally, a great concern is paid to estimate efficient design of cluster size in cluster-based routing protocols.

Clustering is one of the effective network management approaches that enhance the lifetime of IoT. The primary challenge in the data transmission across IoT is designing an energy-efficient clustering mechanism. Existing protocols struggle with the non-optimal selection of CHs and frequent re-clustering on IoT, which leads to significant energy consumption. If the cluster head (CH) lifetime of the devices (nodes) is known prior, then re-clustering can be avoided to a reasonable extent. Therefore, in this paper, we estimate the lifetime of devices as CHs by solving a linear optimization problem to extend the first node death as much as possible and also, stalls the frequent re-clustering process to minimize the energy consumption. We also apply the uniform distribution of CHs to ensure balanced energy consumption on IoT devices. The proposed clustering technique named ECFEL (Efficient Clustering using Fuzzy logic based on Estimated Lifetime) for IoT outperforms the existing protocols, namely Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), MODified LEACH (MOD-LEACH), Dynamic k-LEACH (DkLEACH), Novel-PSO-LEACH, FM-SCHEL, and M-IWOCA techniques in terms of first node death (FND), half node death (HND), last node death (LND). Our simulation results showcase that ECFEL is having a better lifetime in terms of FND, HND, and LND, respectively. Furthermore, the experiments also confirm that ECFEL consumes less energy while maintaining a packet delivery ratio for a more extended period.",19 February 2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Priti Maratha,Kapil Gupta","(Department of Computer Applications,National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra,Haryana,India)",India

The development of energy-efficient routing protocols is a crucial challenge in WSNs. This study proposes a novel algorithm called RMOWOA, i.e., Revamped Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm, which utilizes concentric circles with different radii to partition the network. The circles are divided into eight equal sectors, and sections are formed at the intersections of sectors and layers. Each section contains a small number of nodes, and an agent is selected based on specific criteria. The nodes within each section transmit their detected information to the corresponding agent or cluster head. This process is repeated until the base station receives the data. The selection of agents is based on a WOA-based approach, known for enhancing the network's lifetime. The selected agent aggregates the data, performs redundant residue number-based error detection and rectification, and forwards the information to the lower segment's agent within that sector. The proposed RMOWOA algorithm is evaluated through simulation analysis and compared with established benchmark cluster head selection schemes such as SFA- Cluster Head Selection, FCGWO-Cluster Head Selection, and ABC-Cluster Head Selection.

In a sensor network where the sensing area is very large, transmitting data directly from far away sensor node to base station results into higher energy consumption. If data is indirectly forwarded through other cluster heads, energy holes are created near the base-station, as nodes closer to the base-station have to forward more data. In the proposed approach, all cluster heads forward data directly as well as through other cluster heads, to balance the energy consumption across clusters. In order to reduce the synchronization overhead, a LDC-MAC (Chauhan and Gore 2012) protocol is used, that efficiently manages data forwarding during sleep period.

As these networks have limited resources, it is crucial to optimize their usage to enhance network performance. To achieve this, software-defined network technology is integrated into wireless sensor networks to efficiently utilize network resources. Furthermore, optimized clustering and energy-aware routing techniques are employed to evenly distribute network traffic and enable energy-efficient data transmission in SDN-enabled WSNs. However, the issue of hotspots or energy holes consistently persists in cluster-based routing protocols. This research aims to develop an energy-aware routing protocol incorporating a mobile sink, aiming to achieve energy consumption equilibrium and extend the network's lifespan. To address these concerns and ensure the longer sustainability of SDN-enabled WSNs, a novel approach called mobile sink-based energy-aware routing is proposed for energy-efficient data delivery.

Initially, the given geographical area is divided into clusters and the leader nodes for all the clusters are selected based on some criteria. Following the cluster formation phase, data sensing and data communication begin within the cluster for both periodic and non-periodic data using the proposed Energy-Aware Reliable MAC (EARMAC) Protocol. The proposed EARMAC protocol follows a hybrid method of data sensing that combines the advantages of both the techniques of CSMA/CA and variable TDMA approaches. Suitable MAC protocols are chosen for effective data sensing. The data sensed by the members within the clusters are passed to the aggregating node namely the leader node which helps in avoiding redundancy and helps in power savings. Finally, the data from the leader nodes are to be sent to the destination node using appropriate multi-hop communication. A number of leader nodes in various clusters are used in the intermediate process and help in transporting the data to the destination. Proper method of data acknowledgements and queue thresholds are used in ensuring data reliability and to avoid excessive control overhead. Queue thresholds also serve as a congestion delimiter contributing to reliability. The proposed MAC is efficient for sensing periodic data and event-based data. The proposed EARMAC uses the concept of queue threshold levels to avoid data redundancy.

IoT sensor devices in the network are provisioned with limited resources, such as little processing speed, minimal computing capacity, and less power. Furthermore, IoT devices are battery-powered, which cannot provide battery sufficiently to some applications resulting in an energy scarcity problem. Clustering is an efficient method in IoT networks to save energy. Nodes can coordinate communication by selecting an optimal cluster head (CH) within the cluster and transmitting information to a central node or sink. The CH minimizes energy consumption associated with communication overhead and extends the overall lifespan of the network by facilitating coordination between clusters and the central server. Many existing optimization techniques have proposed CH selection to improve the network's lifespan but all the existing algorithms on CH selection are not practical due to the long convergence time. This research paper proposes a novel fuzzy-based Harris Hawks Optimization (FHHO) algorithm that chooses optimal CH considering Residual energy (RER) and distance between sink and node. The fitness function is evaluated using fuzzy logic over maximization and minimization network parameters. Extensive experimentations were conducted to test and validate the performance of proposed FHHO algorithm on MATLAB 2019a tool. And, the results stated that the proposed method FHHO has better results as compared to other CH selection techniques, namely, PSO-ECHS, FIGWO, and GWO-C, in network lifespan by 18–44% and throughput by 5–20%.",21 June 2024,Telecommunication Systems,"Sankar Sennan,Somula Ramasubbareddy,Rajesh Kumar Dhanaraj,Anand Nayyar,Balamurugan Balusamy","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Sona College of Technology,Salem,India),(Department of Information Technology,VNRVJIET,Hyderabad,India),(Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research (SICSR),Symbiosis International (Deemed University),Pune,India),(Graduate School,Faculty of Information Technology,Duy Tan University,Da Nang,550000,Viet Nam),(Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence,Greater Noida,India)","India,India,India,India,Viet Nam"

The data transmitted by each sensor node cause significant energy consumption and it has to be efficiently used to improve the lifetime of the network. The energy consumption can be reduced significantly by incorporating mobility on a sink node.

The Data collection by the MDT is formulated as a discrete optimization problem which is termed as a data gathering tour problem. To reduce the distance traveled by the MDT during its tour, a nature-inspired heuristic discrete firefly algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally collect the data from the sensor nodes.

Radio communication in sensor nodes is highly expensive operation in terms of energy usage. Energy can be conserved in an efficient way with specifically customized routing techniques. Data aggregation methods when applied to sensor nodes, clusters are created where data generated from cluster members is aggregated. This kind of data collection strategy results into energy efficient communication. Integration of data aggregation and clustering approach is enabled through customized hierarchical routing strategies. Clustering technique is key to apply and exploit, the advantages in-network data processing offers. This paper compares various clustering protocols like LEACHC, K-means and its variants.

This paper proposes an optimal routing method to reduce energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. In the first step, wireless sensor nodes are clustered with the Water strider algorithms (WSA), and cluster heads are selected for routing. In the second step, a mobile sink collects the packets from the cluster heads and sends them to the base station. The mobile sink uses the Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms to travel a shorter path between the cluster heads. The authors contribute to presenting a discrete version of the WSA algorithm for cluster head selection to reduce energy consumption.

In the sensing field, Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs) can freely move for collecting data from sensors. An MDC begins its periodical movement from the base station and finally returns and transports the data to the base station. In physical environments, the sensing field may contain various obstacles. A research challenge is how to find an obstacle-avoiding shortest tour for the MDC. Firstly, we obtain the same size grid cells by dividing the network region. Secondly, according to the line sweep technique, the spanning graph is easily constructed. The spanning graph composed of some grid cells usually includes the shortest search path for the MDC. Then, based on the spanning graph, we can construct a complete graph by Warshall-Floyd algorithm. Finally, we present a heuristic tour-planning algorithm on the basis of the complete graph.

In the present optimized energy-efficient routing protocol (OEERP), some sensor nodes (residual nodes) are discarded without being part of any cluster in the cluster formation process, called generation of residual nodes. Such discarded nodes transfer the inadequate information, either directly to the next best hop or to base station. In transmission of the useless control messages, energy is wasted, causes the reduction of sensor network’s life period. The key objective of this proposed scheme is to enhance the surviving period of WSN with the help of assistant cluster nodes. Energy optimization is achieved by developing an Improved-Optimized Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol (I-OEERP) which eliminates such residual nodes creation and enhances the network lifetime. The nature of the given scheme C-GSA is based on a hybrid of both Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA).

LEFUCMA encompasses neighbor finding, cluster head selection, clustering and routing protocols. The neighbor finding protocol organizes the network into a sectored-layers structure. The cluster head selection uses fuzzy logic with residual energy, number of neighboring nodes, packet reception rate and distance of node from MS as fuzzy descriptors for cluster head selection. For even distribution of traffic, LEFUCMA uses fuzzy logic with node density and distance of area from MS as fuzzy descriptors to decide number of cluster heads in a given area. To avoid hot spots problem, LEFUCMA uses an unequal clustering mechanism with clusters closer to MS having smaller sizes than those farther from MS. Finally, inter-cluster routing protocol decides the next hop cluster head considering its residual energy, distance from MS and from current cluster head which represents energy required for communication, number of cluster members which represents intra-cluster traffic and number of descendant nodes which represents inter-cluster traffic.

WSNs are nodes made up of tiny SNs (sensor nodes) that are scattered over locations to monitor physical or environmental conditions. Previous techniques proposed for WSNs have several drawbacks, such as more energy consumptions emphasising the need for efficient clustering procedures. Hence, the motivation of this research work is in overcoming this issue. This work proposes OEECSs (Optimized Energy Efficient Cluster-based Scheduling Schemes) for WSNs to balance sensor network lifetimes and energy efficiencies. Clusters formed using OEECSs arebased on distances between cluster’s members and CHs (Cluster Heads). Formations of clusters are based on KFCM (Kernel-Based Fuzzy C-Means) clustering. CHs are responsible for controlling network’s energy threshold valuesand determine power consumed by Cluster’s members. CHs are chosen using the AWBOAs (Adaptive Weight Butterfly Optimization Algorithms) and subsequently time slots for data packets from cluster’s members are used ensuring lack of congestions in locations. The CHs selects the most efficient way for delivering data from source to destination without any loss of packets in transmission mode. As part of this multi-hop routing approach, packets of data are sent through every cluster member before the computed data is emitted, allowing it to be received by all members of the clusters. All nodes send their data to the sink based on specific criteria, where the routing channel is optimized for energy consumption. WSN routing protocols are more important than typical protocols in this study because of the cluster-based approach.

In particular, we focus on developing energy management and data routing policies that adapt their behaviour according to the energy that is harvested, in order to maximise the amount of information collected given the available energy budget. In so doing, we introduce a new energy management technique, based on multi-armed bandit learning, that allows each agent to adaptively allocate its energy budget across the tasks of data sampling, receiving and transmitting. By using this approach, each agent can learn the optimal energy budget settings that give it efficient information collection in the long run. Then, we propose two novel decentralised multi-hop algorithms for data routing. The first proveably maximises the information throughput in the network, but can sometimes involve high communication cost. The second algorithm provides near-optimal performance, but with reduced computational and communication costs.

Multilevel heterogeneous network model for wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11235-016-0174-2,25,article,Springer,"Energy efficiency,Network lifetime,Homogeneous node,Heterogeneity node,Clustering,Number of rounds","The lifetime of a network can be increased by increasing the network energy. The network energy can be increased either increasing the number of sensors or increasing the initial energy of some sensors without increasing their numbers. Increasing network energy by deploying extra sensors is about ten times costlier than that using some sensors of high energy. Increasing the initial energy of some sensors leads to heterogeneous nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a multilevel heterogeneous network model that is characterized by two types of parameters: primary parameter and secondary parameters. The primary parameter decides the level of heterogeneity by assuming the values of secondary parameters. This model can describe a network up to nth level of heterogeneity (n is a finite number). We evaluate the network performance by applying the HEED, a clustering protocol, on this model, naming it as MLHEED (Multi Level HEED) protocol. For n level of heterogeneity, this protocol is denoted by MLHEED-n. The numbers of nodes of each type in any level of heterogeneity are determined by the secondary model parameter. The MLHEED protocol (for all level heterogeneity) considers two variables, i.e., residual energy and node density, for deciding the cluster heads. We also consider fuzzy implementation of the MLHEED in which four variables are used to decide the cluster heads: residual energy, node density, average energy, and distance between base station and the sensor nodes. In this work, we illustrate the network model up to seven levels (\(1\le n\le 7\)). Experimentally, as the level of heterogeneity increases, the rate of energy dissipation decreases and hence the nodes stay alive for longer time. The MLHEED-m, \(m=2,3,4,5,6,7\), increase the network lifetime by \(73.05, 143.40, 213.17, 267.90, 348.60, 419.10\,\%\), respectively, by increasing the network energy as \(40, 57, 68.5, 78, 84, 92.5\,\%\) with respect to the original HEED protocol.

In this article, we address a scenario where a subset of sensors, called anchor nodes, knows its own position and helps other nodes determine theirs through range-based positioning techniques. Such techniques benefit from a high degree of connectivity, since range measurements from at least four anchor nodes are necessary (three-dimensional scenario). On the other hand, WSN topologies, most notably the cluster-tree topology, tend to limit connectivity between nodes to save energy. This results in very poor performance of the network in terms of localization. In this article, we propose LACFA, a network formation algorithm that increases the probability of localization of sensors in a cluster-tree topology. It does so by properly allocating anchor nodes to different clusters during the network formation phase. Our algorithm achieves very high localization probability when compared with existing cluster formation algorithms, at no additional cost.

Although WSN allows the spatial monitoring of real-world events, the mobility action depletes a huge part of a sensor’s energy cost in wireless communication. WSN sensors are often prone to various faults as frequent crashes and temporary or permanent failures. This is because it propagates them in very complex and harsh environments. So, we tend to design a Self-Adaptive based Autonomous Fault-Awareness (SAAFA) model, to limit the impact of such failures and filter them. In this paper, we incorporate the two of adaptive-filters FIR with RLS through three adaptive two-stages performed at the level of cluster head, for independent fault-correction during the propagation platform. The proposed model (SAAFA) included two stages, the first stage comprised self-detection the failure and self-aware for the lost scales, in which relied on responses of delay port and prior-knowledge of absent sensor-signals throughout monitoring, through adjusting the filter weights in the adaptive feedback loop for awarding convergent signals for the lost ones. The second stage is adaptive filtering the registered signals from the above stage for gaining pure measures and free of interferences. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the scheduled model attained a speed in diagnosing faults and awareness the missing readings with a rate of accuracy reached 98.8% improving the robustness of performance.

Heterogeneous sensor nodes have more advantages as compared with homogeneous with the advancement of energy and resources in the network. In this work, nodes are distributed among multiple regions where all the nodes are divided into certain clusters. The clusters automatically elect the cluster heads (CHs), which are carriers of data to sink node. Multi-objective differential evolution is used to select the shortest path among the CHs and the base station.

Clustering routing is considered the most popular method to lessen energy utilization at present. In this paper, a fuzzy logic and particle swarm optimization-based clustering routing protocol called PFCRE is proposed to improve energy efficiency, mitigate the energy holes and enhance the network lifetime as well. The proposed PFCRE considers energy minimum and balance to form clusters by using an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Moreover, a fuzzy inference system is employed to find the optimal route for each CH, which considers effective parameters including residual energy, distance to base station and number of being selected as relay so as to not only minimize energy consumption but also balance traffic load. Especially, the rules of the fuzzy inference system are tuned by another particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, an adaptive maintenance mechanism is used to organize the clusters instead of periodic clustering to further diminish computation and message overheads. The performance of PFCRE is evaluated by extensive experiments, and the results indicate that it outperforms IBRE-LEACH, EAUCA, DAPFL, IPSOGWO along with FMSFLA in terms of network lifetime, throughput, energy consumption, and standard deviation of CH’s traffic load.",26 April 2024,Cluster Computing,"Huangshui Hu,Xinji Fan,Tingting Wang,Yuhuan Deng,Chuhang Wang","(College of Computer Science and Engineering,Changchun University of Technology,Changchun,China),(College of Computer Science and Technology,Changchun Normal University,Changchun,China)","China,China"

WBANs serve as a solution to facilitate the tasks performed in the medical sector, and minimize the chances of errors during the process of medical diagnosis. Due to the unreliable wireless media, the communication in a WBAN is exposed to a variety of attacks. These attacks pose major threats to WBAN security. In order to overcome these threats, several cryptographic techniques have been proposed in the recent past. Effectiveness of these cryptographic techniques largely depends on a good key management scheme. However, using an expensive key management scheme is not feasible in highly resource-constrained WBANs. Therefore, we propose and evaluate an energy-efficient key management scheme for WBANs that takes into account available resources of a node during the whole life cycle of key management. Our proposed scheme is a cluster-based hybrid security framework that supports both intra-WBAN and inter-WBAN communications. By using multiple clusters, energy-efficiency can be ensured. The cluster formation process itself is secured by using electrocardiogram (EKG)-based key agreement scheme. The proposed technique is hybrid because we use both preloading of keys and physiological value-based generated keys. We use highly dynamic and random EKG values of the human body for pairwise key generation and refreshment. The performance comparison of our proposed cluster-based key management scheme and low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH)-based key agreement scheme shows that the proposed scheme is secure, more energy-efficient, and provides better network lifetime.",27 August 2013,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,"Aftab Ali,Farrukh Aslam Khan,Farrukh Aslam Khan","(National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences,A.

To improve the lifetime of a sensor network, it is essential to achieve load balancing among the sensor nodes. The grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is an efficient technique for conserving energy. Cluster Heads are elected for each of these clusters, in order to collect and aggregate the data from the sensor nodes within a cluster and forward it to the sink through a single-hop or multi-hop relay. In a multi-hop relay, cluster heads near to the sink are exposed to heavy traffic. The energy of these nodes is soon depleted and this is referred to the ‘hot-spot’ issue in sensor networks. This paper proposes a geo-clustering process based on the location of the sink. Each of the clusters is assigned a set of geo-cluster heads, in which a primary cluster head is assisted with one or more secondary cluster heads. to compensate the hot-spot issues arising due to inter-cluster traffic, clusters near to the sink are assigned with larger sets of geo-cluster heads than the clusters located far from the sink. This setup allows the clusters nearer to the sink to share the load of the single CH used in traditional approaches. The proposed clustering approach benefits from reduced number of hot-spots and gives rise to considerable savings in energy.

In clustering algorithms, although the continuous execution of clustering phase and dynamic cluster head selection lead to energy consumption parity, they cause considerable energy dissipation due to the need for message transmitting to set new clusters and cluster heads.

Initially, the network is divided into cells by the algorithm. Then, the genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal number of nodes. In other words, after placement of the nodes in the environment, given that the base station is aware of the energy of remaining nodes, the chromosome length is set equal to the number of nodes that their residual energy in a specific area is greater than the average energy of neighboring nodes in the same specified area. Therefore, the chromosome length is reduced and we will move with a faster convergence in reaching the optimal solution.

Thus, IoT-based networks are most vulnerable to simple or complex attacks that need to be identified in the early stage of data transmission for saving the network from these malicious attacks. The chief goal of the proposed work is to design and form the intelligent intrusion detection system (I-IDS) using the machine learning models such that the attacks can be identified in the IoT network. The model is built considering the normal and malicious attacks on the data that are generated in IoT smart environment. To simulate such a model, a testbed is built where a wireless router, a DHT11 sensor, and a node MCU are being used during the design phase. An attacker or adversarial system is built to perform poisoning and sniffing attacks using a laptop system. The node captures the sensor values and transmits the data to the ThinkSpeak platform, during the normal phase via the wireless gateway, and in the attack phase, the malicious attacker interprets the data, modifies it while transmitting from node to the ThinkSpeak server. Thus, the attack called Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) is performed and classified as abnormal data. Various machine learning algorithms are performed on the data, and finally, the results obtained using a probabilistic model called as Markov model have a high performance evaluated based on the I-IDS IoT network. The results obtained during the experimental analysis show that the Markov model has obtained a 100% detection rate and 19% of false alarm rate (FAR) with high precision and low error rate. The algorithms such as naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and Adaboost are considered in comparison with the Markov model.

Optimal rendezvous points selection and mobile sink trajectory construction for data collection in WSNs,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-021-03566-2,17,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Data collection,Mobile sinks,Minimum-cost spanning tree,Rendezvous points","In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the energy-hole or hotspot problem is an important, challenging issue because it isolates some nodes from the sink. The hotspot problem is addressed by introducing a mobile sink, where the mobile sink traverse in the WSN, collects the data from rendezvous points (RPs) instead of visiting each sensor node. But, selecting the best set of RPs and mobile sink trajectories is challenging in the WSNs. In this context, this paper proposes an optimal RP and trajectory construction (ORPSTC) for the mobile sink in WSNs for data collection. Initially, we apply the minimum spanning tree-based clustering approach for RP selection. In this stage, an RP is identified from each partition, whereas other nodes can transmit the data to RP. Next, we construct a trajectory for mobile sink among all the RPs, including the sink node using a computational geometric method. It results in a near-optimal route with minimal computational resources. Further, we also apply the RP re-selection and virtual RP selection strategy to balance the energy among the SNs. We simulate and evaluate the proposed ORPSTC and existing approaches, and the proposed work outperforms among them.",25 October 2021,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,"Bala Gangadhara Gutam,Praveen Kumar Donta,Chandra Sekhara Rao Annavarapu,Yu-Chen Hu","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Siddartha Educational Academy Group of Institutions,Tirupati,Andhra Pradesh,India),(Distributed Systems Group,TU Wien,Vienna,1040,Austria),(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Indian Institute of Technology (ISM),Dhanbad,Jharkhand,826004,India),(Department of Computer Science and Information Management,Providence University,Taichung City,43301,Taiwan)","Austria,India,India"

For each network round, each node decides its role (such as, cluster header (CH) or a normal node) and its priority level for activity operation. The priority level also affects the active/sleep scheduling in the node. In the steady-state phase, the positive priority levels of active nodes determine their activity order to avoid transmission collision, and to reduce redundant data transmission and sensing coverage. Since the data reporting to the sink is usually performed by a CH delivery chain, subsidiary CHs are selected to assist with data delivery and to share the loading of CHs.

Limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of communication, computation, and storage, present challenges to protocols designed for WSNs. Due to the severe energy constraint of sensor nodes, among the major concerns is the problem of designing efficient energy-aware routing protocols. Numerous routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. Cluster-based routing protocols for large-scale WSNs have some advantages as compared to a flat network topology. Clustering results in a reduced number of messages that propagate through the network in order to accomplish a sensing task. It also offers improved power control. Quality of Service (QoS) is becoming an important feature of data routing in WSNs. QoS is required for real-time data transmission when the result of a sensing task is dependent not only on the correct sensing of the environment but also on the timely delivery of the event notification to the monitoring center, the Sink. The emergency preparedness and response class of applications, for instance, impose delay requirements on the delivery of event notification messages. Transmitting video and imaging data poses certain bandwidth, delay, and jitter requirements on the routing protocols.

Simulation results and data analysis shows the performance of proposed protocol is more efficient in terms of overall performance as compared to other existing routing protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks and it was simulated in NS2 simulation software environment.

The first criterion can be fulfilled by adopting trustworthy nodes for data communication along with choosing watchdogs for monitoring. Additionally, the use of the clustering scheme reduces energy exhaustion substantially. Accordingly, effective data gathering requires trust-aware and energy-efficient clustering, data gathering tree construction, and watchdog selection. The previous data gathering algorithms did not include all of the clustering, tree construction, and watchdog selection phases. Furthermore, some studies proposed greedy schemes to solve the mentioned phases and had low performance. In this paper, we propose the Trust-aware and Energy-efficient Data Gathering (TEDG) algorithm to gather data more effectively. The proposed scheme comprises all the above-mentioned phases, including clustering, tree construction, and watchdog selection. These phases are modeled as optimization problems, and they are solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The watchdog selection phase has variable-length particles because the number of watchdogs has not been unknown. Novel particle representation and initialization schemes are proposed to handle these particles.

Wireless sensor networks are utilized for many array of applications where determining precise location of the sensors are treated to be the crucial task. The prime job of localization is to determine the exact location of sensors placed at particular area as it makes the reference of anchor nodes to determine the location of remaining nodes in the network. Position information of sensor node in an area is useful for routing techniques and some application specific tasks. The localization accuracy is affected due to the estimations in anchor node placements. Localization information is not always easy as it varies with respect to the environment in which the sensors are deployed. Ranging errors occur in hostile environments and accuracy effects as there are signal attenuations in sensors when deployed underwater, underground etc. Efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the error using localization algorithms. Particle swarm optimization is one approach to overcome the localization problem.

The spatial relationship can be utilized productively in order to conserve the power banks by halting some sensors to transmit the same information. This paper deals with the segregation of network into the correlated clusters based on correlation value. On the one hand, unlike existing clustering techniques relying on residual energy and distance to select cluster heads, this paper defines more realistic three-dimensional correlation model where cluster heads are elected on the basis of the correlation value, residual energy, and required energy. On the other hand, other than developing theoretical three-dimensional correlation model, a fuzzy-based clustering technique is also proposed to further implement the developed correlation model, where the nodes with similar information are gathered in such a way that data from a solitary node suffices the fidelity constraint to the sink. The effects of node density, sensing range, and the threshold value is studied in detail. Also, the correlation model is clubbed with clustering technique to further take the advantages of exploiting spatial correlation at the network layer. The results have revealed that proposed approach extend network lifetime by 30, 35 and 78% as compared to the FBUC, CHEF, and LEACH respectively. The results of clustering using correlation model show that the number of participating nodes get reduced by 33% when correlation threshold value is decreased from 0.8 to 0.6. Also, it is found that network lifetime gets improved by decreasing the correlation threshold value.Graphical abstract

This study mainly discusses the routing optimization strategy of the IoT perceptive layer based on the improved cat swarm algorithm. This study simulates a perceptive network with 100 nodes deployed randomly. As SDWSN for Internet of Things applications, in order to simulate the data transmission requirements of IoT communication and ensure the fairness of experimental comparison, this study uses the pseudo-random mechanism to generate the source address and destination address of data packets. A special SDN controller node is added to the network. The SDN controller node broadcasts information to each sensing node, and the common sensing node sends node information to the SDN controller. The SDN controller can survive the global time graph of the entire network according to the information of the common node. In order to avoid the problem of high energy consumption of cluster heads caused by long-distance data transmission, the cat algorithm protocol adopts multi-hop communication between cluster heads and BS and uses network overhead index to quantify link overhead as the basis for cluster heads to select the next hop node. When the inter-cluster multi-hop route is successfully established, the wireless sensor node begins to collect data and send it to BS node. Six monitoring nodes, two coordinators and one workstation were selected as the test objects. The data volume sent by each node was 2000, and the accuracy rate of test transmission information at different rates and transmission distances was determined. The group network coverage rate of cat swarm algorithm is always above 95%, and the average energy loss of nodes is the highest and less than 36%. The results show that the aggregate of energy consumption of cluster heads and the variance of energy consumption are the lowest in the improved cat cluster algorithm, which ensures the reliable transmission of node data.",02 January 2021,Neural Computing and Applications,"Xiang Xiao,Ming Zhao","(School of Computer Science and Engineering,Central South University,Changsha,410000,Hunan,China)",China

In this study, we measured changes in biochar recalcitrance and solubility after 7 years of weathering in a cultivated field. Biochar recalcitrance and biodegradability of weathered and unweathered hardwood biochar mixtures were determined by thermal analysis (differential scanning calorimetry) and evolved gas analysis. Differences in biochar solubility and the chemical composition of biochar-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined by repeated laboratory leaching and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The surface carbon-oxidation state (Cox) of biochar increased by 117.6–158.2% with weathering in the field, and there was an average of 0.9–1.2% decrease in biochar C contents per year. However, thermal indices of biochar recalcitrance and biodegradability, which suggested intermediate C sequestration potential, were not significantly different between weathered and unweathered biochars. The O:C ratio increased with weathering suggesting an increase in biodegradability, however, both weathered and unweathered biochars were still estimated to have half-lives of over 1000 years. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) concentrations from the unweathered biochar rapidly decreased during laboratory leaching to levels similar to the field-weathered biochars, and aromaticity (SUVA254) of WSOC increased from 5.9% in the unweathered biochar to 42% aromaticity in the biochars weathered for 7 years. We conclude that during short-term (years) weathering under field conditions, there is continued solubilization of increasingly aromatic biochar-C compounds, however, this accounts for a relatively small proportion of biochar C such that there is little-to-no change in biochar stability or C sequestration potential after field application.",15 November 2019,Biochar,"Elizabeth K.

One way to achieve this goal is to reduce the amount of redundant data sent to the base station (BS) through an aggregation operation carried out by the coordinating nodes. The clustering approach is considered as one of the most energy-efficient approaches for routing data in WSNs because in this approach the cluster-heads are responsible for the aggregation of the data packets, which reduces the amount of data sent to the BS.

A Novel Load Balancing Scheduling Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10922-018-9473-0,24,article,Springer,"Energy saving,Cluster-heads distribution,Load balancing,Life time duration,DEACP approach,NS2 simulator,Wireless sensor networks","Clustering is a well-known approach to cope with large nodes density and efficiently conserving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Load balancing is an effective approach for optimizing resources like channel bandwidth, the main objective of this paper is to combine these two valuable approaches in order to significantly improve the main WSN service such as information routing. So, our proposal is a routing protocol in which load traffic is shared among cluster members in order to reduce the dropping probability due to queue overflow at some nodes. To this end, a novel hierarchical approach, called Distributed Energy efficient Adaptive Clustering Protocol (DEACP) with data gathering and Load-balancing is proposed. The DEACP approach aims to fulfill the following purposes: decreasing the overall network energy consumption, balancing the energy dissipation among the sensor nodes and as direct consequence: extending the lifetime of the network. In fact, the cluster-heads are optimally determined and suitably distributed over the area of interest allowing the member nodes reaching them with adequate energy dissipation and appropriate load balancing utilization. In addition, nodes radio are turned off for fixed time duration according to sleeping control rules optimizing so their energy consumption. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol is carried out through the well-known NS2 simulator and the exhibited results are convincing. Like this, the residual energy of sensor nodes was measured every 20 s throughout the duration of simulation, in order to calculate the total number of alive nodes.

The MWSN allows the sensor nodes to move freely and they are able to communicate with each other without the need for a fixed infrastructure. These networks are capable of out-performing static wireless sensor networks as they tend to increase the network lifetime, reduce the power consumption, provide more channel capacity and perform better targeting. Usually routing process in a mobile network is very complex and it becomes even more complicated in MWSN as the sensor nodes are low power, cost effective mobile devices with minimum resources. Recent research works have led to the design of many efficient routing protocols for MWSN but still there are many unresolved problems like retaining the network connectivity, reducing the energy cost, maintaining adequate sensing coverage etc. This paper addresses the various issues in routing and presents the state of the art routing protocols in MWSN. The routing protocols are categorized based on their network structure, state of information, energy efficiency and mobility.

Various techniques have been developed to optimize WSNs, but there are still some limitations. Clustering has been a highly effective method for efficient communication with low power and battery usage in high-speed communication systems. In this work, an Improved Squirrel Search Algorithm (I-SSA) is developed for selecting the cluster head (CH) node in WSNs. The improved I-SSA algorithm introduces a sine chaotic mapping strategy to boost population diversity, a backward learning mechanism to constrict the selection of excellent solution sets, and a cross-learning mechanism to enhance the accuracy of the algorithm optimization procedure in order to confront the drawbacks of the SSA algorithm, including such easy having fallen into local optimal solution and inadequate variability. The fitness function, which is employed to assess the performance of the solutions generated by the optimization algorithm, plays a key role in this cluster head selection process. Four parameters including residual energy, average intra-cluster distance, average sink distance, and CH balance factor are used in the fitness function. Network density analysis was performed by changing the number of sensor nodes (SNs) from 100 to 500 and randomly distributing them in the simulation region. For the simulation study, we utilize the most recent and stable release of MATLAB, version 2021a.

However, such application environments expose the nodes to physical capture, damage and misbehaviour attacks. In addition, the compromised nodes potentially increase network congestion by advertizing false information. The loss of critical information due to significant congestion and node misbehavior attacks adversely affect emergency operations. The traditional cryptographic and authentication based secure schemes can’t be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehaviour attacks. Furthermore, existing trust based routing protocols incur high control overheads in trust estimation and dissemination; lead to high number of dead nodes due to adopted route discovery mechanism and suffer from high route instability. In this paper, we present an Energy-aware Secure Routing with Trust (ESRT) scheme that maintains a trusted environment and isolate misbehaving nodes.

Both moving and fixed nodes are possible for these. Maintaining node stability or improving inter-node connectivity is the main task for every IoT network. These networks are portable, leading to an overwhelming production of control overhead transmissions which can be reduced with the help of network clustering. In order to extend the network’s lifespan, it is therefore necessary to improve the power usage of sensor nodes. The goal of this research work is to improve network lifetime, increase throughput, reduce packet latency or packet loss, and even expand to addressing threatening nodes in order to cope with the issues of IoT-based sensor systems. The proposed Improved Smart Energy-Based Routing Protocol (ISERP), once combined with a wireless energy harvesting (WEH) unit, improves the node’s lifespan, the network’s quality of services (QoS) amid higher unequal congestion, and those aspects controlling its availability of energy. In the framework of distributed IoT, this protocol meets the standards of QoS through employing hardware-based link quality estimation and accomplishing very high efficiency in terms of energy in comparison with existing routing methods.

In the wireless sensor networks, deploying a small amount of heterogeneous nodes which directly communicate with the Sink node, can form shortcuts.

In this paper, we investigate the idle listening and hotspot problems with respect to the clustering routing technique in WSNs. Some of the studies in clustering centered around equal clustering scheme while others were based on unequal clustering scheme. Equal clustering scheme avoids inter-cluster idle listening as the intra-cluster data collection can be completed at the same time across all clusters in the network but lead to hotspot problem due to additional traffic relay experienced by cluster heads near the base station. Similarly, unequal clustering addresses hotspot problem but lead to inter-cluster idle listening due to the use of global network-wide intra-cluster collection among clusters of unequal sizes and densities. In this paper we proposed a zone-based clustering scheme referred to as hybrid equal and unequal clustering (HEUC) that jointly address inter-cluster idle listening and hotspot problems to maximize the lifetime of WSNs. To achieve this, the network area is firstly partitioned into zones. The size of clusters in the same zone is designed to be equal and cluster size increases across zones as the distance from the BS increases. Secondly, the density of nodes deployed in each cluster per zone is obtained in such a way that the distribution of nodes in zones away from BS increases according to the radius increase in clusters across the zones. Thirdly, a deterministic deployment strategy is used to deploy nodes into various clusters. Fourthly, we implement a zone-wise intra-cluster data collection strategy that allows intra-cluster data collection to be completed at once to address inter-cluster idle listening. Lastly, a multihop routing is used for data forwarding to BS. The result shows that our proposed HEUC has 38% and 51% lifetime improvement against EBULRP and AECR respectively.",05 April 2021,Wireless Networks,"Nura Modi Shagari,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Rosli Bin Salleh,Ismail Ahmedy,Ghulam Murtaza,Aznul Qalid Bin Md Sabri,Nura Modi Shagari,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Ghulam Murtaza","(Department of Computer System and Technology,Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology,University of Malaya,50603,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia),(Department of Computer Science,Sokoto State University,Sokoto,Nigeria),(Centre for Mobile Cloud,Computing University of Malaya,50603,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia),(Department of Computer Science,Sukkur IBA University,Sukkur,Pakistan)","Malaysia,Malaysia,Niger,Nigeria,Pakistan"

In most cases, the energy units of sensors cannot be replaced or replenished. Therefore, the need for energy efficient and robust algorithms for load balancing in WSNs is ever present. This need is even more pronounced in the case of cluster-based WSNs, where the Cluster Head (CH) gathers data from its member nodes and transmits this data to the base station or sink. In this paper, we propose a location independent algorithm to cluster the sensor nodes under gateways, as CHs into well defined, load balanced clusters. The location-less aspect also avoids the energy loss in running GPS modules. Simulations of the proposed algorithm are performed and compared with a few existing algorithms.

Time slot allocation is done centrally by Master Station (MS) to provide a collision-free and fair media access. MS allocates same transmission slot to nodes that are two hops apart to increase channel spatial reuse and decrease data latency. For data gathering at MS, SOFLEE uses parenthood willingness to forward data to MS through unidirectional tree rooted at MS. Parenthood willingness of a node is decided using: (i) its location with respect to MS, to forward data in correct direction; (ii) its number of children, to prevent local congestion; (iii) its residual energy, to uniformly distribute energy load of being a parent node and (iv) its parent–child communication link reliability to guarantee consistent data delivery. The parenthood willingness requires simple comparisons against thresholds, and thus, is very simple to implement on memory and computationally constrained nodes. Unlike a conventional TDMA-based protocol, SOFLEE provides flexibility to transfer data slots among nodes and priority based slot scheduling to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns of various Wireless Sensor Network applications. Finally, simple, memory and energy efficient techniques for: (i) hop-by-hop congestion control; (ii) catering to orphan nodes, link breakdowns and node deaths are incorporated in SOFLEE.

In order to satisfy these requirements, routing protocols of WMSNs has to concentrate on minimum energy route for data forwarding. Link quality analysis together with energy parameters is one of the major techniques for electing energy aware and reliable route path in WMSN. Sending multimedia data via dynamically changing wireless links adds the trust of each node in data forwarding as an important factor in route selection.

Typically, they consist of a large number of sensor nodes that are used remotely to collect data about the activities and conditions of a particular area, for example, temperature, pressure, motion. Each sensor node is usually small, inexpensive, and relatively easy to deploy compared to other sensing methods. For this reason, WSNs are used in a wide range of applications and industries. However, WSNs are vulnerable to different kinds of security threats and attacks. This is primarily because they are very limited in resources like power, storage, bandwidth, and processing power that could have been used in developing their defense. To ensure their security, an effective Intrusion detection system (IDS) need to be in place to detect these attacks even under these constraints. Today, traditional IDS are less effective as these malicious attacks are becoming more intelligent, frequent, and complex.

Trust in WSNs is the confidence in secure, efficient collaboration among nodes, crucial for reliable data packet routing. However, their susceptibility to trust-related challenges such as different threats, high energy use, and communication issues among nodes, pose substantial challenges to data integrity and availability. Recognizing the pivotal role of trust in ensuring secure data exchange and dependable device communication within the IoT framework, this paper introduces a novel trust-aware optimization technique. The approach integrates trust management into routing protocols, employing the resilient decision-making algorithm Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) for trusted clustering and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for routing.

For certain surveillance applications in WSN, coverage lifetime is an important issue and this is related to energy consumption significantly. In order to handle these two interlinked aspects in WSN, a new scheme named Weight based Coverage Enhancing Protocol (WCEP) has been introduced. The WCEP aims to obtain longer full coverage and better network life time. The WCEP is based on assigning different weight values to certain governing parameters which are residual energy, overlapping degree, node density and degree of sensor node. These governing parameters affect the energy and coverage aspects predominantly. Further, these four different parameters are prime elements in cluster formation process and node scheduling mechanisms. The weight values help in selection of an optimal group of Cluster Heads and Cluster Members, which result in enhancement of complete coverage lifetime.

Wireless sensor networks are considered as one of the main infrastructures in the IoT systems. Therefore, decreasing the total energy consumption of sensor nodes and prolonging the network longevity are two important challenges that should be considered. To increase energy efficiency and to improve the network longevity, a two-level distributed clustering routing algorithm based on unequal clusters has been proposed for large-scale IoT systems. The main idea is to decrease the data transmission distances between member nodes and cluster heads to mitigate the hot spot problem by distributing two cluster heads in each cluster, which in turn leads to energy conservation and load balancing. The clustering method is two level due to the benefits it offers for the sensor nodes. First, each node can transfer its data to the nearest cluster head because a primary cluster head and a secondary cluster head have been considered for each cluster. Therefore, the nodes far from the primary cluster head can be organized based on their distances to the closest cluster head to reduce their data transmission distances to the cluster heads. Second, two cluster heads can be replaced with each other in different circumstances. This reduces the overhead of the cluster head selection algorithm in the proposed scheme. Third, the sensor nodes can benefit from the primary and secondary cluster heads to transfer the data to the sink through different paths with the minimum energy consumption.

Wireless sensor networks are relatively simple, scalable networks with many applications in research. They can provide many benefits, including ad hoc distribution, lower costs, and higher flexibility. In a scenario where time is of the essence and dedicated base stations cannot be established, mobile sinks must be used to gather data. IoT systems are based on a collective organization in which devices collaborate to provide better and more accurate decisions. It is important to ensure that the information being shared is legitimate to avoid any significant degradation in system performance because of false or inaccurate information. Building trust—the “assurance” between two devices that the information being shared can be used with confidence that it is accurate—will create a trustworthy, secure system in which all devices are identified and no information is accepted from any unauthorized device. The key contribution of this work is a new, dynamic, trust-based clustering mechanism by which nodes can securely connect to one another and begin transmitting data to a sink while it is available. To demonstrate the utility of this mechanism, we examine two possible attacks on a trust-based network and present a heuristic solution for minimizing the negative effects of such attacks in an energy-efficient way. Our results show improved network performance through reduction of the number of cycles required to isolate or mitigate the effect of malicious nodes in the network, thus reducing the energy consumption in the network with a concomitant increase in its lifespan.

To address security concerns in MANET, both prevention and detection methods have been utilized.

Energy conservation has huge importance in wsn since it is virtually impossible to recharge the nodes in their remote deployment.

Hence efficient routing protocols should be used in forwarding the data to the base station in order to minimize the energy consumption thereby increasing the life-time of the network. In this proposed routing protocol, we consider a hierarchical routing architecture in which nodes in the outer-level forwards data to the inner-level nodes. Here we optimized the routing path using ant-colonies where data moves along minimal congested path. Further, when ant-colony optimization is used, certain cluster-head nodes may get overloaded with data forwarding resulting in early death due to lack of energy. To overcome this anomaly, we estimated the amount of data a neighboring Cluster-head can forward based on their residual energy.

Frequent changes in position of nodes due to water current cause network partitioning. This often results in frequent network failures and causes void spaces. Frequent network failures lead to unreliable data transmissions where nodes injudiciously drain their power resource. Such a network needs to adapt its network routing in order to diminish the challenges caused by node mobility. A dynamic approach addressing the issues of node mobility will also enhance the network lifetime. Node mobility creates articulation points (AP) in the network topology. AP is similar to bridges in a graph. AP leads to partitioning of the network that only yields failed and unreliable transmission. Cat Swarm Optimization is explored here for detecting a possible partition in the network prior to its occurrence in the seeking mode of the algorithm. In the tracking mode of the algorithm the cat with the closest distance to the predicted AP is selected to move towards the predicted AP in order to avoid the network from partitioning. The proposed approach enhances the network lifetime as it avoids disconnections and failed transmissions. It would conserve energy consumption of nodes by reducing the possibilities of failed and retried transmissions.

Nowadays, IoT Sensor-Cloud ecosystem has been adopted to collect data from IoT sensors and transmit it to the chosen Cloud Server for further processing and dissemination. In a large Wireless Sensor Network formed by the IoT sensors, there will be a significant amount of redundancy in the dataset when the nodes are placed closely, and the sensed data varies slowly and gradually with regard to time and space. Then, avoiding redundant data transmission can lead to lower energy consumption and communication overhead. Adaptive subset selection of sensor nodes for data size reduction in a Wireless Sensor Network is an approach to efficiently managing the amount of data transmitted within the network. Then, in the current time schedule, it is possible to optimally select a subset of the sensor nodes for data collection without very much affecting the overall data fidelity. An optimal sensor node subset selection scheme that reduces the communication load with minimum information loss is proposed to achieve this task. The unselected nodes are put in sleep mode, which consequently results in lower sensor energy expenditure. The subset selection algorithm is implemented based on the derivative-free pattern search optimizer that minimizes the reconstruction error during the associated extrapolation. This approach differs entirely from the Compressive Data Gathering approach.

These sensors collaboratively monitor the area to detect the sensors’ readings that deviate from normal reading patterns after which a phenomena is declared. This research proposes a distributed algorithm to detect dynamic phenomena using mobile WSNs under the assumption that there is no centralized server to collect and aggregate the sensors data. Therefore, the sensors self-organize into disjoint groups by first electing a few sensors to be group heads (GHs) and then the rest of the sensors group themselves with the nearest GH. Each group of sensors detect phenomena locally. Then, the GHs communicate the detected local phenomena information among themselves to aggregate the information and detect the global phenomena. Moreover, the paper proposes two GH election algorithms, namely the Last Group Head election algorithm and the Distributed Group Head election algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed election algorithms reduce the energy costs of the mobile WSN by 54–66 % as compared with the straightforward election algorithm. In addition, this paper proposes an optimization technique to further reduce the energy costs of reporting the global phenomena to about 33 % by reducing the size of the reported phenomena information.

In CM applications, each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed data to the sink node, while in event-detection driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node. Hence, CM applications entail much higher energy consumption since all nodes are actively transmitting information much longer than typical EDD applications. Furthermore, in highly dense WSNs, the energy consumption is even higher. As such, the use of autonomous devices that provide a constant energy supply is becoming relevant for these environments.

Many clustering techniques were proposed with different characteristics. The main goal of them is to facilitate a power-aware communication between a large number of deployed nodes. One of the important factors which affect the clustering process is the distribution of the nodes. In many real situations, the distribution of nodes is random. This type of distribution produces a network with different density sub-regions. A different number of nodes in each sub-region of the network means different communication load and therefore different energy consumptions. This work proposes a distributed density-based clustering technique called “spatial density-based clustering for WSNs.” It aims to achieve balanced energy consumption all over the constructed clusters. This is done with the help of a simple initial spatial analysis for the distribution of the nodes before the clustering process. This analysis divides the network to sub-regions according to their density level. Clusters formed in each sub-region will use a suitable size according to the measured density level.

This approach first assigns an index for each possible value for a sensed reading. Then, it starts giving a number for each sensed reading. For each newly sensed reading, this number is increased by one. When the SN wants to send a sensed reading, it sends its location in the lookup table represented by the least number of bits (which will have shorter length than the length of corresponding index for the sensed reading in the indexing table), if it exists in the lookup table.

The objective of topology control in this context should not be to minimize the spent energy and maintain a reduced topology, but to maximize fault tolerance in the network and increase the sensing coverage region. In this work, we first describe a taxonomy of existing topology control schemes and analyze the impact of reduced topology over fault tolerance and sensing coverage. We then describe the necessity of new design parameters in the presence of harvest-able ambient energy. We also outline guiding principles for designing a harvesting enabled topology control scheme. To cater for whether such a scheme is feasible or not, an insight is also provided onto the solar energy availability from solar radiations for near perpetual operation—as an example of available ambient energy. Based on the insight gained from the solar radiations availability, we explain why new design parameters are required for performance measurement of harvesting enabled sensors.

Clustering provides an effective means of tackling the issue. It could reduce energy consumption of the nodes and prolong the network lifetime. However, cluster heads deplete more energy since they bear great load of receiving, aggregation and transmission data than sensor nodes in WSNs. Therefore, the load-balanced clustering is a most significant problem for WSNs with unequal load of the sensor nodes but it is known to be an NP-hard problem.

In a WSN, most of the on-demand routing protocols replace the routing metric of the prevalent routing protocol with their proposed routing metric and keep the route discovery mechanism intact, which is not sufficient to increase the performance of the WSN. To address these problems, a novel Congestion-aware and Traffic Load balancing Scheme (CTLS) for routing has been proposed. The CTLS proactively avoids congestion through a novel route discovery mechanism to select the optimum node based on a composite metric. If congestion occurs, CTLS tries to detect it in a timely manner and alleviates it reactively using a novel ripple-based search approach. The simulation results show that the CTLS performs better as compared to the congestion avoidance, detection and alleviation and no congestion control schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio, ETE delay, throughput, and energy consumption per data packet in a resource constraint wireless network.",15 January 2016,Telecommunication Systems,"Omer Chughtai,Nasreen Badruddin,Azlan Awang,Omer Chughtai,Maaz Rehan","(Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR),Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS,Tronoh,Malaysia),(COMSATS Institute of Information Technology,Islamabad,Pakistan)","Malaysia,Pakistan"
Multilayer cluster designing algorithm for lifetime improvement of wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-014-1108-y,28,article,Springer,"Multilayer cluster designing,Centralized cluster design,Distributed cluster design,Network lifetime improvement,Wireless sensor network,Large-scale network,Medium-scale network","Cluster-based network is a proven architecture for energy-aware routing, but more attention is required to ameliorate the energy consumption aspect of its cluster designing process. In this research work, we introduce a novel design of clustered network architecture. The proposed design technique is innovative in its idea. The general trend in this scene is either centralized decision at base station for cluster head selection and its members or distributed decision by exchanging information between neighboring nodes until the cluster head and its members are selected. Both the techniques drastically create mess in energy consumption due to too much broadcasting, especially in large networks as well as message exchange until some final decision is made. Our novel layer-based hybrid algorithm for cluster head and cluster member selection comes up to novel communication architecture. Since its substantial constituent is cluster designing, we named it Multilayer Cluster Designing Algorithm (MCDA). The proposed design not only has effect on lessening blind broadcasting, but also on decreasing the message exchange in a passionate way. It also encapsulates the beauty of efficient centralized decision making for cluster designing and energy-aware distributed cluster head selection and cluster member allocation process. Comprehensive experimentations have been performed on the comparative analysis of MCDA with state-of-the-art centralized and distributed cluster designing approaches present in published literature. Calculation of energy consumption in various operational parametric values, number of clusters designed and the number of packets broadcasted during cluster designing are the main performance evaluation parameters. It has been found that MCDA outperforms compared to its three competing algorithms with respect to the aforementioned parameters due to its multilayered synergistic mating approach.",09 February 2014,The Journal of Supercomputing,"Sohail Jabbar,Abid Ali Minhas,Sohail Jabbar,Abid Ali Minhas,Anand Paul,Seungmin Rho","(Department of Computer Science,Bahria University,Islamabad,Pakistan),(Department of Computer Science,COMSATS Institute of Information Technology,Sahiwal,Pakistan),(CCIS,Al Yamamah University,Riyadh,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia),(The School of Computer Science and Engineering,Kyungpook National University,Daegu,Korea),(Department of Multimedia,Sungkyul University,Anyang-si,Korea)","Pakistan,Pakistan,Saudi Arabia"
Meta-heuristic Ant Colony Optimization Based Unequal Clustering for Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-019-06127-1,47,article,Springer,"Cluster head selection,Energy efficient,Energy consumption,Fruit fly optimization,Quality of service (QoS),Unequal clustering,Meta-heuristic Ant Colony Optimization (MHACO)","Sensor nodes are randomly deployed to perform specific area monitoring in geographical region and temporal space. The network connectivity maintenance is a major requirement for accurate event detection with minimum energy consumption. To minimize the energy consumption, various clustering algorithms have been evolved in research studies. But, they failed to consider the other performance parameters such as quality of service constraints and the performance level. The initialization of nodes nearer to the base station (BS) as relay nodes reduces the number of relay node participation and increases the performance. This paper proposes the novel ant colony meta-heuristic based unequal clustering for the novel cluster head (CH) selection. The data fusion from the CH node to the intermediate node called Rendezvous node reduces the message transmissions and hence the energy consumed by the nodes is minimum. The neighbor finding phase and the link maintenance through the Meta-Heuristic Ant Colony Optimization approach selects the optimal path between the nodes which increases the packets delivered to the destination. The population initialization requires more time at this stage. Hence, the Haversine distance is estimated among the nodes which also reduces the dimensionality of the message transmission among the nodes. The prediction of optimal path and the CH selection using Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic and unequal clustering reduces the energy consumption effectively. The comparative analysis of proposed Meta-Heuristic Ant Colony Optimization based Unequal Clustering with the existing unequal clustering approaches on the basis of various performance parameters such as Packet Delivery Ratio, number of packets sent to the BS, energy consumption, residual energy and the percentage of dead nodes shows the effectiveness of proposed work in WSN applications.",25 February 2019,Wireless Personal Communications,"Kalpna Guleria,Anil Kumar Verma","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Thapar University,Patiala,Punjab,147001,India)",India
Clustering Method of Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization Sensor Networks Based on Multifactor Conflict,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11182-021-02481-5,none,article,Springer,"multi-factor conflict,chaotic particle swarm optimization,sensor network,clustering method,energy balance","In order to solve the multi-factor conflict problem in a cluster head selection process, to optimize it and prolong the network life cycle, a chaotic particle swarm optimization method based on the multi-factor conflict is proposed for clustering the sensor networks. The object of study is a sensor network with a hierarchical clustering network topology, which includes cluster member nodes, cluster head nodes and sink nodes. The energy consumption model of data acquisition and processing in the network nodes is constructed. Four kinds of multi-factor collision problems of the node residual energy, the inter-nodal energy balance and the distance between the base stations, as well as the probability of the node acting as a cluster head are discussed. An energy balance index based on the standard deviation of the node residual energy is introduced to construct an adaptive degree function to obtain the relationship between the current and the previous adaptive degrees of particles. Then, the inertia weight is determined. The chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the adaptive inertia weight is used to optimize the cluster head selection. The nodes in the communication area are regarded as the cluster members. The cluster head number can meet the optimal cluster head number, which further improves the network energy efficiency. The simulation results show that the death time of the first node, the half node and the last node of the sensor network clustered by this method is 83.33%, 34.14% and 43.14% longer than that of the LEACH method, respectively. The energy consumption of the sensor network clustering is low, the network life cycle is long and the clustering effect is good.",03 December 2021,Russian Physics Journal,"Lijun Liu,Jin Qian,Aiping Zhou,Ye Zhu","(College of Computer Science & Technology,Taizhou University,Taizhou,China)",China

In the infrastructure of IoT, wireless sensors can be used in order to reduce communication costs. Despite having positive effects, using wireless nodes add some challenges to the system. Limited resources, such as energy, CPU power and memory, are the main concerns in this technology. Energy consumption is the most challenging one. Designing an optimized routing pattern through heuristic algorithms is a common way to tackle this problem. Therefore, in the proposed algorithm, a WOA-based method has been proposed to expand the life span of the system.
 Also, a novel fitness function is defined for reducing the energy consumption of the network, load balancing and node coverage. Clustering is done unequally; it means that cluster heads (CHs) nearer to the base station (BS) have more energy for data relay. In this paper, for reducing the number of messages, a clustering stage is added at the beginning of each metaround. The number of rounds in a metaround is variable. The status of each node is analyzed by BS before each round. Low energy level causes a new metaround. Moreover, the CH–BS interaction is implemented through multi-hop pattern. Results suggest that there is an enhancement instability, energy-saving, throughput and lifespan.",15 January 2021,Soft Computing,"Seyed Mostafa Bozorgi,Mahdi Rohani Hajiabadi,Ali Asghar Rahmani Hosseinabadi,Arun Kumar Sangaiah","(Department of Computer Engineering,Tehran North Branch,Islamic Azad University,Tehran,Iran),(Faculty of Computer and Information Technology Engineering,Qazvin Branch,Islamic Azad University,Qazvin,Iran),(Department of Computer Science,University of Regina,Regina,Canada),(School of Computing Science and Engineering,Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT),Vellore,632014,India)","Canada,India"

Connectional weights are the coordinates X, Y and E, which correspond to every unit of map, i.e., energetic nodes. The self-organizing neural network forms high-energy clusters based on the nodes in the network right after the training and reorganization of weights.
