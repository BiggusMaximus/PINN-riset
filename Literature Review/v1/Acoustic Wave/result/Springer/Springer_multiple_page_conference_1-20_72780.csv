"Analysis of the Lifetime and Energy Consumption of WSN Routing Protocols: LEACH, EAMMH and SEP",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-5232-8_54,1,conference,Springer,none,"
The lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is based on the energy of each sensor. Therefore, numerous routing protocols have been introduced such as SEP (Stable Election Protocol), LEACH (Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) and EAMMH (Energy Aware Multi-hop Multi-path Hierarchical routing protocol) to stable the lifetime of WSN by efficient utilization of energy of the sensors. In WSN networks data is collected and forwarded wirelessly to the base stations. Routing protocols in WSN provide an efficient path for multi-hop communication because the transmission range and battery power storage of nodes is limited. As nodes are usually deployed in remote areas so, they face challenges of long lifetime, network architecture, security issues, and network coverage. Many routing protocols have been developed to increase the efficiency of networks. Out of these clustering algorithms are the best choice to increase the lifetime of the nodes. Each protocol has its limitations in different scenarios. In this paper, we discussed and compared the performance of LEACH, EAMMH and SEP. SEP is an efficient algorithm due to its weighted cluster head (CH) selection method. Simulation results are obtained using MATLAB. Design metrics of energy consumption and network lifetime are under consideration in this research work.

Effectively managing energy within WSNs is crucial to extend network longevity and ensure continuous data collection. This study introduces an implementation of the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, a widely adopted approach for energy-efficient clustering in WSNs. LEACH addresses energy imbalances among sensor nodes by dynamically selecting cluster heads in a distributed manner. In this implementation, we propose a novel cluster head selection technique that incorporates a weighted metric considering three key parameters: node energy level, energy gradient, and distance from the sink. The introduced metric aims to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the protocol in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed LEACH implementation in achieving energy-efficient clustering and extending the network’s operational lifespan. Experiments conducted using MATLAB R (2021b) software demonstrated that the proposed algorithm increased the network lifespan by 41.18% and resulted in a significant reduction in energy consumption by about 65.38%.

The rising demands with energy efficiency have been motivation for research on more efficient routing solutions. LEACH being most effective, but with less attention towards dynamics of topology and QOS requirements, has limited its ace. This paper proposes a network adaptive multi-mode LEACH protocol (M2M-LEACH) to meet QoS and energy efficiency requirements of IoT/M2M communication system. It performs a network adaptive grid partitioning, accommodating three different transmission modes—node to gateway (CNG), node to base station (CN-BS) and node to the cluster head (CH) and CH to base station (BS) while considering residual energy and inter-node distance for CH selection. Thus, the strategic implementation of the aforementioned multimode transmission with multi-parameter adaptive CH selection enabled timely and reliable transmission over large-scale dense WSN.

A Low Energy Multi-hop Routing Protocol Based on Programming Tree for Large-Scale WSN,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77383-4_93,none,conference,Springer,none,"In large-scale conditions, due to the number of nodes and the spread of space range are larger, the energy consumption of sensor nodes in the network is more serious, which proposes the higher energy requirements on WSN routing protocols. In this paper, the energy saving scheme of WSN routing protocols is analyzed and classified, and we find that the traditional routing protocols have a lot of room for improvement. In these protocols, cluster head selection usually adopts a random selection method by considering the cluster head rotation, but the cluster head can’t keep a reasonable distribution. At the same time, the lack of reasonable planning of the communication path between cluster heads causes a large communication overhead. For this, we put forward a low energy adaptive clustering multi-hop routing protocol based on programming tree (LEACH-PT). The routing protocol takes consideration in the structure within the cluster, the remaining energy of nodes and so on. Based on these factors, the protocol makes the selection of cluster head optimal. Through the method of programming tree, the protocol builds the routing path of the cluster head. Analysis and simulation results show that our protocol provides better balance in energy consumption among nodes and can prolong network lifetime significantly.

In this paper we present a life-time and throughput comparative study passing from classical clustering protocols (LEACH) to a hybrid routing protocol, combines between clustering and Multi-hop Routing techniques (SMR). SMR introduces another type of nodes, called Independent Nodes (IN), whose role is to help Cluster Heads (CHs) to route their collected data to the Base Station (BS). Finally, a comparative study is done, in the first place, between LEACH and SMR in a homogeneous network. And in a second place between LEACH, DEEC and SMR in heterogeneous environment. Those simulations show a great improvement in network’s life-time and throughput using SMR technique in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environment when the base station is far from the center of the network, and less performance when the SB is placed in the middle of the network.

Energy efficiency (EE) in WSN is an essential issue that will raise the network's liability over the following months or even years. Routing in WSNs is quite challenging due to such networks’ intrinsic characteristics from other telecommunications networks, like national ad hoc networks or cellular networks. Clustering is the most common energy efficiency technique and provides many advantages such as energy efficiency, life cycle, scalability, and lower latency. A new form of swarm intelligence approach focused on humans’ collective actions, namely, the brainstorming process, is the brainstorming Optimization algorithm (BSO). It is not just an optimization process; it can also be used as an optimization development platform.",04 January 2022,Proceedings of Third International Conference on Sustainable Computing,"Ankur Goyal,Bhenu Priya,Krishna Gupta,Vivek Kumar Sharma,Sandeep Kumar","(Department of CSE-AIT,Chandigarh University,Chandigarh,Punjab,India),(Yagyavalkya Institute of Technology,Jaipur,India),(Jagannath University,Jaipur,India),(Department of Computer Science and Engineering,CHRIST (Deemed To Be University),Bangalore,India)","India,India,India,India"
An Opinion Dynamics Based Advance SEP in Three Level Heterogeneous WSN,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-0287-8_59,none,conference,Springer,none,"The wireless sensor network (WSN) has become a foremost field of investigation in the communication field. There are various extensions of WSN including MANET, VANET, and so on. Due to its vast applications, it has inherited several challenges. The challenges lie in improvement of energy efficiency, reliability, network, lifetime, and the like. The stability period is very important to a network as a large instable region would reduce the packet delivery ratio severely. The stability period is explained as the time from the emergence to the time at which the opening node expires. Censorious matter of wireless sensor networks is enlarging the span of performance (lifetime). Because of finite energy resources, there exist a number of deficiencies. This becomes a major problem in heterogeneous networks inasmuch as LEACH is not effective in this case. This paper proposes a novel opinion dynamics model-based advanced stable election protocol designed for reducing the unstable region in a network with three-level distribution of energy. The opinion dynamics modelling is based on the nature of human discussion where people discuss with different opinions of their own and finally arrive at a common conclusion. A social influence factor is calculated and opinions are updated accordingly. The probabilities of each node for being selected as cluster head are optimised using this model. The results are found to be quite encouraging and the instability region is shown to be very narrow. The packet delivery ratio is also seen to be improved.",10 May 2016,"Emerging Research in Computing, Information, Communication and Applications"," Virpal Kaur, Vikram Dhiman","(Department of Computer Science,LPU,Phagwara,144001,India)",India

The data transmission nodes are a group of heterogeneous sensor node (SN) fitted with a battery, which are deployed randomly for monitoring of surrounding. Clustering algorithms with effective routing protocols are used to handle the random deployment of nodes. This results in redundant data packets being aggregated and dropped, enabling sound data transfer from sensor node to the Base Station (BS) through Cluster Head (CH). Different Energy optimization Routing Protocols have been introduced in previous years but have not been able to examine protocol behavior in different environments. An adaptive, sub-clustering and multi-hop routing protocol is proposed in this paper with experimental based analysis, taking into consideration energy and distance. That create smooth and simple route from the cluster nodes, cluster head, and sub-cluster head to the base station. Experimental studies show a substantial increase in network lifetime efficiency by comparing the proposed method with the present situation.

Environmental sensing, health care monitoring, border surveillance, forest monitoring is some of the application areas of wireless sensor networks. Sensory nodes sense relevant data which will be forwarded to base station. Wireless sensor nodes are remotely deployed therefore they may remain unattended for long. The energy utilization is thus a key challenge in wireless sensor network. Various algorithms have been proposed for efficient energy utilization in wireless sensor network.

Coverage in WSN is crucial as it measures the quality of monitoring. This requires finding of optimal number of sensors (cost of the network) at optimal locations to cover the given 3D space. Here, Harmony search scheme has been employed for maximizing coverage and reducing the network cost. The Network coverage ratio, the minimum distance between two sensors and the number of sensors are the parameters that have been incorporated in the objective function. Simulation results have proved the capability of proposed scheme by providing maximum network coverage by placing lesser number of sensor nodes at optimal locations. In addition, incorporation of minimum distance parameter in objective function has reduced overlapping of sensor nodes and reduced the cost of the network by 25%.

Here, every member node in a cluster sends the messages to its Cluster Head (CH) as its next hop. The CHs collect data from all nodes in their clusters, aggregate and compress the data and forward it to the sink. If the sink is in direct communication range of the CH, the data can be sent directly, else a multi-hop route can be selected which consists of other CHs. The energy consumption of CH is more than the common nodes because of the extra computational work it must perform. Periodic CH selection is done to maintain the energy balance in the network. Partitioning the Region of Interest (RoI) into clusters, selecting the CH for each cluster, and choosing the communication method from CH to sink constitute the basic clustering or partitioning problem. The paper focuses on the comparative study of available techniques for clustering and aims to identify the drawbacks in them with the objective of outlining the future challenges to be overcome in the efficient clustering of WSNs.",01 July 2024,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving,"Nishi Gupta,Shikha Gupta,Aprna Tripathi,Mohit Agarwal","(The NorthCap University,Haryana,India),(Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology,GGSIPU,Delhi,India),(School of Information Technology,Manipal University Jaipur,Rajasthan,India),(School of Computer and Communication Engineering,Manipal University Jaipur,Rajasthan,India)","India,India,India,India"

Due to its numerous advantages, they are widely spreading in various industries. WSNs are made of numerous sensor nodes and a node or storage node. The sensor nodes are responsible for sensing the surrounding physical environment like pressure, temperature, etc., and the collected data is transported to the storage node and base station. Due to its various advantages, they are used in many industrial applications such as war zones, automated medical applications. One of the main considerations of a WSN is security. WSNs are used in a few important domains like military, etc., where security is extremely important. In such cases, data confidentiality and authentication play an important role. Hence security algorithms have to be included in order to maintain privacy. A WSN has limited resources like battery power, storage capacity and processing capability. Hence they have to be utilized efficiently. In this paper, a Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is implemented in MATLAB. And RSA encryption is done for safe data transfer between the nodes in a wireless sensor network. Initially, some amount of energy is allotted to all the nodes in the WSN. All the nodes are allotted with a unique Id, type of the cluster. There are two phases of implementation, namely set-up and steady phases. Once the cluster head is nominated, the encrypted data is sent from the one node to the other destination node in a WSN. RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the data before the data is sent over from the starting node. The data is again decrypted at the destination node.

Because of the limited power supply of the SNs, WSN becomes an energy constraint network. So, to extend the network's lifetime, it is required to build energy-effectual protocols. Clustering is an important mechanism that offers an effective way to lower the consumption of energy. However, several soft computing techniques are used for cluster head (CH) selection. Due to the dynamic nature of the environment and random deployment of the SNs, the Type-I fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used that deals with uncertainties of the WSNs and provides accurate results compared to the traditional clustering mechanism. Uncertainties of Type-I FLS are improved by Type-II FLS. So, it is widely used in WSNs for cluster head selection which increases the network performance. In this paper, various clustering protocols using Type-II FLS for cluster head selection are reviewed based upon their properties like the energy of node, node density, node centrality and the distance between the nodes, historical contribution as a CH, efficiency, link quality, and moving speed of the nodes, which helps to attain maximum network lifetime, minimum energy consumption, higher packet delivery ratio, secure data transmission, maximum throughput, and scalability.

A large WSN network is often difficult to analyze due to its complexity. Analysis of such networks requires the use of graph sampling techniques. Graph sampling helps in obtaining a sample graph that has properties similar to that of the original graph. Graph sampling algorithms show biasness towards high degree nodes. For taking into account the low degree nodes, we propose to use a spanning tree protocol that helps in obtaining an efficient connected graph. Use of spanning tree protocol provides a tree-based structure to the graph which can then be used to obtain a sampled graph offering better connectivity. To analyze such networks, we implement the concept of non-probabilistic spanning tree along with default connecting dominating set (CDS) strategy.

So, the improved delay PSO (DPSO) is employed during the data transfer phase to choose the most energy-efficient relay node based on the cost of the node and the end-to-end delay.

An Autonomous Energy-Aware Routing Scheme: a Supplementary Routing Approach for Path-Preserving Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-09490-8_5,1,conference,Springer,none,"One of the hottest research topics is how to reduce energy consumption to prolong the lifetime of a WSN. Some nodes of a WSN may be isolated from others, particularly when all their neighbors have crashed or run out of energy, and are thus no longer helpful in collecting and relaying messages, even though their batteries still retain some level of energy. To avoid this, in this paper, we propose a supplementary routing approach, named Energy-aware routing (EnAR in short), which can help to extend the lifetime of a WSN by integrating itself with the routing scheme of the host WSN. With the EnAR, a node in a given WSN (denoted by host WSN) checks the amount of its remaining energy, each time the node receives a request, to see whether it should reject or accept the request. The WSN routes messages through other communication paths when nodes on the original path have consumed too much energy under the condition that alternate paths truly exist. One of the alternate paths will be chosen to relay messages to prevent nodes along the original path from exhausting all their energy so that the WSN can last longer. Our experimental results show that this scheme is applicable to and suitable for an environment with decentralized control, and is able to effectively prolong the lifetime of a WSN.",2008,Advances in Ad Hoc Networking,"Fang-Yie Leu,Guo-Cai Li,Wen-Chin Wu","(Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering,Tunghai University,Taiwan)",

Deep learning network and fuzzy based data aggregation approaches are used in a wide range of research projects to analyse wireless sensor Circumstances.

Energy consumption, scalability, and QoS optimisation with overhead all play a role in WSN data processing efficiency. Propose a Machine Learning Data Aggregation Model for WSN improvement (EML-DA). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of low-cost, low-energy sensor nodes that collect and transmit data about their surroundings to a sink or coordinator node. Thus, effective techniques should be implemented to conserve energy and extend network lifetime by reducing network load, since WSNs are power-constrained. Clustering can be used to partition the network into clusters, each of which has a cluster head where data is collected. It is possible that sensor nodes within a cluster will collect data that is redundant, increasing the overall quantity of data packets that must be delivered to the cluster head. Consequently, there is a requirement to consolidate cluster-head data so that redundant data can be eliminated and data can be compressed with fewer packets to be transferred across the network.

Sigmoid Function-Based Energy Optimization Strategy for Multihop Routing in WSNs,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-0327-2_14,none,conference,Springer,none,"Energy consumption of the wireless sensor network depends on various factors of network such as transmission distance, control signal overhead, duty cycling, and sensing of the signal. Among these factors, duty cycle and transmission distance are the most important factors. Designing of energy optimization strategy for multihop wireless sensor network becomes more challenging due to: (1) routing problem for multihop transmission, (2) residual energy of intermediate nodes for relaying, and (3) network energy utilization during transmission. The strategy proposed in this paper works in dual mode for energy minimization: intra-cluster energy minimization and inter-cluster energy minimization. Since for the transmission of a packet in intra-cluster energy minimization, longer distance node consumes more energy than the shorter distance node. Therefore, more transmission time is given to the shorter distance node and vice versa. This is achieved by assigning dynamic distance adaptive duty cycle to the nodes of the cluster using sigmoid function (SF). The performance of the proposed sigmoid function-based duty cycle (SFDC) strategy has been compared with the other two existing energy optimization protocols: low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and stable election protocol (SEP). The simulations for the evaluation of all the strategies have been performed on the metrics of packets delivered to base station (BS), number of dead nodes, available network energy utilization, network energy utilization for relaying, and average energy needed (in mJ) for transmission of a packet. These parameters have been calculated for increasing number of rounds and nodes. Results show that packet deliveries for LEACH and SEP (70:30) strategies are 96.93% and 66.87% of the proposed SFDC strategy, respectively. Furthermore, higher network energy utilization and less energy consumption of the proposed strategy have been obtained than other existing strategies.",24 April 2024,Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Computing,"Madhav Singh,Laxmi Shrivastava","(Department of Electronics Engineering,Madhav Institute of Technology and Science,Gwalior,M.P.,India)",India

The life extension of a wireless sensor network has been explored in this study by locating a large number of disjoint set coverings. All of the targets were covered by each separate group of sensors. Instead of maintaining all sensor nodes in operation, the only way to prolong the service life by about K times is to use the sensors of one cover while the sensors of the other covers are in sleep mode. This approach saves both energy and time by processing useful data and reducing duplicate data coming from different sensors in a region. Different configurations of sensor networks have been tested using an evolutionary computation-based computer intelligence technique, as well as a genetic algorithm and differential evolution.

Since most wireless sensor nodes are powered by batteries, energy efficiency is very important for WSN, and many existing routing protocols aim to reduce energy consumption. At present, the emergence of cross technology communication (CTC) enables direct communication between heterogeneous nodes at the physical layer. Therefore, new routing algorithms need to be designed for WSN based on CTC, which considers the heterogeneous characteristics of sensor nodes such as the energy heterogeneity, the mobility of LTE nodes, etc. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient fuzzy clustering routing protocol based on CTC, which is named as Fuzzy-K.

In the proposed protocol, the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) is used twice to select the initial cluster center and the final CH. The input parameters of these two systems are obviously different, which considers the differences in frame length, mobility and other heterogenous characters between nodes.

The BS aggregates the data received from several SNs for meaningful analysis-deployed environment. Energy conservation is the major challenge in the WSN. Since SNs are battery-operated over a period of time, SNs drain their energy in sensing the region of interest and passing on the same to the BS. The consumption of energy depends on the distance between SNs and BS.

The Comparison Analysis of Cluster and Non-cluster Based Routing Protocols for WAPMS (Wireless Air Pollution Monitoring System),https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-2422-3_12,none,conference,Springer,none,"With increasing industries, the air pollution monitoring system has become the main challenge of intelligent cities. Several methods have been developed in APMS, and WSNs seem like the solution to sensors, because of less cost, and dense deployment. Thus, the deployment of the sensors is significant for better performance while assuring less economic cost. WSN is related to the set of distributed sensors for monitoring the PHY situations and arranging the gathered data at the central position. In this article, a comparative analysis is defined in routing protocols for WAPMS to study and defined the advantages and disadvantages. The conclusion showed the prior protocols into two different classes such as cluster and non-cluster based routing protocols. The cluster-based methods have designed the PHY network into virtual classes, whereas the non-cluster based protocols both use broadcasting tools for data communication cluster-based routing protocol, compared to LEACH; TLLEACH is based on the two-level cluster heads (CHs) with less communication distance, and less hop is necessary to transfer for distance to the base station.

Utilizing Cooperative-MIMO for an Event-Based Data Transmission in a Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-5546-6_56,1,conference,Springer,none,"An efficient use of energy is a challenging task in battery-constrained WSN. Cooperative-MIMO (CMIMO) where the nodes cooperatively transmit data packets to the base station (BS) is an efficient way that leads to huge energy savings. But still there exists a problem of selection of receiver node by the multiple transmitters. This can be overcome by using an effective selection strategy which ensures end-to-end connectivity as well as lifetime enhancement. In this paper, an Event-driven data transmission Routing Protocol (EDTRP) is proposed for routing and central node (CN) selection. In EDTRP, only the nodes which detect an event are involved in the communication process. If the data sensed by the individual node is above a threshold value of the particular physical attribute in concern, then only the transmitter of that node is switched on. This avoids unnecessary data transmission leading to energy savings. The proposed work shows a significant improvement when compared to the non-cooperative-MIMO scheme such as LEACH and Improved Vice-LEACH (V-LEACH). EDTRP shows an improvement of almost 211% compared to LEACH and 171.30% compared to Improved V-LEACH in terms of half-lifetime.",20 September 2020,"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Microelectronics, Computing and Communication Systems","Monica Kumari,Sanjeet Kumar,Sarah Asheer","(Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering,Birla Institute of Technology,Mesra,Ranchi,India)",India

In the first phase, CH candidates are chosen based on an adaptable energy threshold and the status of neighbor nodes. In the second phase, each candidate computes its own Energy Consumption Cycles (ECC), which is relevant to the CH candidate’s residual energy and the energy consumption when communicating with its neighbor nodes. The ECC actually evaluates the lifetime of the potential cluster. Hence the CH candidate with both higher residual energy and higher ECC has more possibility to be the CH.

DUCA: An Approach to Elongate the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Nodes,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1642-5_30,3,conference,Springer,none,"Clustering the wireless sensor network (WSN) is a persuasive methodology for increasing the sensor nodes’ lifetime. The clustering algorithms normally selects nodes as a cluster head only if the node has abundant remaining energy and quick energy depletion in the nodes is balanced through rotating the cluster heads at regular intervals. Mostly, the WSN is divided into small areas of identical size called clusters, which lead to non-uniform energy loads among the heads of the cluster and member nodes of the cluster. The head nodes of the cluster closer to the sink have a larger burden of the energy load. In order to prolong the premature node failure, it is very much essential to manage the energy load of the nodes. We propose a Distributed Unequal Clustering Algorithm (DUCA), which addresses hotspot issues and imbalanced energy consumption. In the proposed algorithm, the energy load balancing is dealt with by making the cluster size small which is near to sink against the nodes farthest from the sink. For inter-cluster communication and direct routing with the sink, the multi-hop routing technique is implemented. The behavior of the proposed protocol is simulated against the LEACH protocol. The simulation results prove that the proposed unequal clustering method balances uniform depletion of energy in the network and also effectively addresses the hot spot issues. The proposed DUCA enhances the greater improvement in the lifespan of the WSN.",31 October 2018,"Engineering Vibration, Communication and Information Processing","S. B. Bore Gowda,G.

Improved Performance of Wireless Sensor Network Based on Fuzzy Logic for Clustering Scheme,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04585-2_13,4,conference,Springer,none,"The wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of sensor nodes collaborative to collect and transmit data to the end user. Since the network’s long life is an utmost requirement of WSN. Clustering is one of the most effective ways of prolonging the lifetime of the network. In clustering, a node takes charge of the cluster to coordinate and receive information from the member nodes and transfer it to the sink. With the imbalance of energy dissipation by the sensor node, it may lead to premature failure of the network. Therefore, a robust balanced clustering algorithm can solve this issue in which a worthy candidate will play the cluster head role in each round. This paper proposes an improvement of WSN based on fuzzy logic for clustering.

The lack of energy, real-time constraints, and software and hardware failures are the most important challenges in RWSNs. Indeed, several solutions have proposed to come up with these challenges.

M2M Routing Protocol for Energy Efficient and Delay Constrained in IoT Based on an Adaptive Sleep Mode,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69266-1_15,none,conference,Springer,none,"In recent years, the number of machine-to-machine (M2M) networks that do not require direct human intervention has been increasing at a rapid pace. However, the need for a wireless platform to control and monitor these M2M networks, one with both a vast coverage area and a low network deployment cost, continues to be unmet. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with energy efficiency routing protocols in M2M environments are emerging to meet the challenges of such communication through network convergence. M2M communication is considered as the core of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT refers to a network of billions of objects that can send and receive data. Energy efficiency, delay are a critical issue in M2M and there is a shortfall in IP addresses in IoT. In this chapter, an energy efficient routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is presented, which provides a platform to control and M2M networks. Inefficient energy consumption caused by nodes being active all the time is tackled using an adaptive sleep mode solution to maintain high levels of Network Performance (N.P). Firstly, a Multilevel Clustering Multiple Sink (MLCMS) with IPv6 protocol over Low Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is promoted using a sophisticated mathematical equation for electing cluster heads (CH) for each level, so as to prolong network lifetime. Secondly, enhanced N.P that prolongs the life time of the system and maximises the reduction of delay is achieved through an adaptive sleep mode scheme. The sensor field is divided into quarters with different levels of cluster heads (CHs) and two optimal location sinks. The performance of the MLCMS protocol is evaluated and compared with the multi-hop low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (M-LEACH) protocol. MLCMS performs 62% better than M-LEACH and 147% more effectively regarding energy efficiency. Next, 6LoWPAN for the proposed model is constructed, and its impact on the performance of MLCMS by Network Simulator (NS3) simulation is evaluated. This increases the packets received by the system by 7% more than using MLCMS without 6LoWPAN and it improves the flexibility of the proposed model. Subsequently, an adaptive sleep mode scheme, based on CH’s residual energy for the active period time, is introduced for MLCMS and a comparative analysis establishes that it extends the lifetime of the system twice as much as the evaluated MLCMS without the adaptive sleep mode algorithm. Furthermore, with the sleep mode algorithm, this reduces the delay by a half and increases the delivery by 10%.",31 December 2017,Intelligent Systems and Applications,"Wasan Twayej,H. S.
