The existing tree-based algorithm has a few shortcomings; (1) it may take a long path since sensor node must transmit packets via either its parent or its children nodes and (2) it is vulnerable to a link failure since the tree has to be reconstructed in case of a single link failure. We propose Plus-Tree, a routing protocol, which overcomes the shortcomings and improves the performance of the existing protocol.

A distance between the weight factors and obtained nodes interference value is used to establish a useful interference model for enhancing the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR).

Baud Rate-Based Hierarchical Multihop Routing Protocol for WSNs,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-2926-9_52,1,conference,Springer,none,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the data sensed by the sensor node are forwarded to the sink node either by direct communication or by multihop communication. The disadvantage of direct communication is that the sensor nodes consume more energy to reach the sink node as each sensor node has to work alone to reach the sink node, and if the sink node is too far, condition gets worsens. Contrary to direct communication, the multihop communication saves energy as it forwards the data to the nearest neighbor node which in turn forwards the data toward the sink node. In multihop communication, choosing the best neighbor node for forwarding the data is the most challenging task. Hence, in this article, a novel hierarchical multihop routing protocol for WSNs referred to as “Baud Rate-Based Hierarchical Multihop Routing Protocol for WSNs” has been proposed which uses Shannon channel capacity model ‘C’ and neighbor node distance to choose the best neighbor node; the chosen neighbor node will be capable of transmitting data with high baud rate, thereby increasing the throughput of the network. Further, the proposed model also increases the lifetime of the network as the nearest neighbor node will be chosen for the data transfer which saves the energy of the sensor node. The proposed algorithm is compared against the LEACH routing protocol and multihop LEACH protocol and is implemented in MATLAB. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the simulation results depicts that the proposed algorithm performs better against the parameters remaining energy of the sensor nodes, network lifetime, and data throughput when compared to LEACH and multihop LEACH protocols.

Energy dissipation is a major problem in WSN. Clustering and routing are the familiar energy-efficient techniques offering several merits such as energy efficiency, network longevity, scalability, and less latency. Appropriate cluster heads (CHs) and optimal route selection processes can be assumed as the NP hard optimization problem and can be resolved by the use of metaheuristic algorithms. This paper presents a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm-based clustering with multi-hop routing (HMA-CMHR) protocol for WSN. The presented model incorporates different phases such as node initialization, clustering, routing, and data transmission. Firstly, the HMA-CMHR technique uses quantum harmony search algorithm (QHSA) based clustering process to elect an optimal subset of CHs. Secondly, the improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm based route technique is employed for an optimal selection of routes. The experimental results of the HMA-CMHR model are validated under different scenarios based on the number of nodes.

The first algorithm forms hierarchical clusters of spanning trees with a given root, the sink. All of the nodes in the sensor network are then classified iteratively as subroot, intermediate or leaf nodes. At the end of this phase, the local spanning trees are formed, each having a unique subroot (clusterhead) node. The communication and data aggregation towards the sink by an ordinary node then is accomplished by sending data to the local subroot which routes data towards the sink. A modified version of the first algorithm is also provided which ensures that the obtained tree is a breadth-first search tree where a node can modify its parent to yield shorter distances to the root. Once the sub-spanning trees in the clusters are formed, a communication architecture such as a ring can be formed among the subroots. This hybrid architecture which provides co-existing spanning trees within clusters yields the necessary foundation for a two-level communication protocol in a sensor network as well as providing a structure for a higher level abstraction such as the γ synchronizer where communication between the clusters is performed using the ring similar to an α synchronizer and the intra cluster communication is accomplished using the sub-spanning trees as in the β synchronizers.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) ordinarily be composed of a large number of low-power sensor nodes which having several functions, that are a battery powered, and thus have very limited energy capacity. To lengthen the operational lifetime of a sensor network, energy efficiency should be considered in every aspect of sensor network design. In this paper, Enhanced Hierarchical Routing Technique (EHRT) is proposed to overcome the constraint of limited energy capacity of sensor nodes which enhancing the network lifetime and the energy efficiency. The suggested technique is a cluster-based routing which optimizes the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy routing technique (LEACH) by using a modified artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA). This modified AFSA selects the optimum clusters’ head (CHs) locations by applying a number of behaviors following, preying and swarming on each cluster separately and using a modified fitness function to compare these behaviors’ outputs to select the best CHs locations for each cluster separately. A framework for evaluating the performance is constructed and applied to verify the efficiency of the suggested technique comparing to other energy efficient routing techniques; optimized hierarchical routing technique (OHRT), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), and particle swarm optimized (PSO) routing techniques. The proposed technique yields best results than other techniques OHRT, LEACH, and PSO in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime. It reduces the energy dissipation by factor 0.7 compared with OHRT.

In this paper, a bio inspired approach called firefly algorithm is used for selection of CH in WSNs. The synchronous firefly algorithm selects the optimal CH node among all nodes participated in the network, which also increases the performance of the network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has effective CH selection procedure when compared to the other existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm reduced the packet loss ratio by 8.32% and it improved the reduction of energy consumption of overall network.",04 May 2017,"Computer Communication, Networking and Internet Security","D.

Local Adjustment Strategy of Aggregation Tree Based on Energy Sensitivity,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-18458-1_5,none,conference,Springer,none,"This paper discusses wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with two kinds of sensors, normal sensors and relay sensors. Normal sensors (called as sources or A_nodes) with limited energy can generate sensing data and have function of storage and forwarding data. Relay sensors (also called as B_nodes) with sufficient energy only have functions of storage and forwarding data. We consider that environmental factors could affect both sensing strength of sensors and connection quality between any two sensors. Among A_nodes, cluster heads (called as A_heads) are selected randomly and form cluster. Local adjustment is made among clusters in order to obtain clusters with fitting size. Among A_ heads, B_nodes, sink, a backbone shortest path aggregation tree with limited hops and sink as the root would be dynamically established. Both the feasibility and the time complexity of our proposed routing strategy are explained.

Threshold Cryptography Based Light Weight Key Management Technique for Hierarchical WSNs,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20615-4_14,14,conference,Springer,none,"
Secure communication among sensors is strongly needed to avoid malicious activity. Security is a major issue in self-organized, infrastructure less networks with limited resources such as energy, transmission range, and processing. The amount of network overhead needs to be reduced to improve the network performance. The size of the secret key to be communicated among the sensor nodes is also contributing in network performance. The Proposed Light Weight Threshold Key Management Scheme (LWKMS), reduces the size of the secret key to be communicated. It reduces the network resource utilization, in sharing the secret among the sensor nodes in the network and provides efficient security even when the keys are compromised by an attacker node. Simulation results shows that the proposed light weight scheme provides less overhead along with less energy consumption as compared to existing method namely Group Key Management Scheme (GKMS).

LEACH protocol saves energy of the total network by using randomization for distributing the energy load among the sensor nodes and thus it enhances the lifespan of the network. But in the modified protocol, each sensor nodes except the cluster head sends sensed data to its nearest node, not to the cluster head like LEACH.

So Swarm intelligence (group behaviour) is needed for the communication as well as on data collection, Query publication and intrusion detection. To operate MWSNs in a secure way, intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network. Intrusion can also occur in multiple layers of MWSN so continuous investigation of aggregated data to be needed. Proposed work is for SIDI (Swarm Intelligence based Data aggregation for Intruder detection) raising the energy efficiency of a network.

Sensor nodes use the MEMS to interact with the physical environment and extract data regarding events. The random deployment of sensor nodes makes it difficult for the sink node to identify the geographical location of those nodes without GPS connection. The use of GPS for all nodes raises the cost of network deployment. The proposed scheme (GCPL) detects the geographical location of sensor nodes without using GPS. Energy conservation is another important issue in WSN for energy constraint of sensor nodes. Clustering is a well-known technique to reduce energy dissipation in an effective way and increase network life time. In WSN, selection of cluster head is very difficult as in cluster heads energy depletes quickly due to their extra responsibilities. The early break down of cluster heads force to choose new cluster head regularly which leads to decrease of network lifetime. The proposed scheme applies game theory-based clustering technique, in which all sensors declare its own strategy to become a cluster head (CH) or not.

Cost-based, chaining, and clustering models are just a few of the many that inform the creation of routing protocols. It can be challenging to keep track of all of the nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks because there are so many of them. The optimal strategy is to form a cluster out of several nodes. By grouping together, sensor nodes are able to conserve energy and reduce their overall impact on the network. Management and coordination of the cluster’s nodes are performed by the cluster head. In its current configuration, the DEEC functions well during transmissions and has been around for some time in the network. However, a probability strategy based on ACO is used in this research to determine which node within a cluster will serve as the cluster’s leader. It is the responsibility of the cluster head to collect data from each of the individual nodes and then transmit that data to the home station. The ACO-DEEC protocol chooses a leader for the cluster by putting a probability rule that is based on the parameters of the distance between the nodes and the quantity of power they have. As a consequence of this, this algorithm performs better than the conventional DEEC protocol in terms of energy efficiency, the number of packets reached at the base station, and the count of the nodes that fail entirely.",08 August 2023,"Computing Science, Communication and Security","Renu Jangra,Ramesh Kait","(University of Engineering and Management,Jaipur,Rajasthan,India),(Kurukshetra University,Kurukshetra,Haryana,India)","India,India"

Multi-stage Clustering Algorithm for Energy Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0399-3_18,7,conference,Springer,none,"
Clustering technique is one of the approach to optimize energy consumption, balance load and increase lifetime of networks in wireless sensor network (WSN). In this paper, a novel multi-stage clustering algorithm is proposed for heterogeneous energy environment. The proposed multi-stage approach combines the behaviour of a bird and the distributed energy efficient model. The behaviour of the bird is expressed in the form of mathematical expression and then translated into an algorithm. The algorithm is then combined with the distributed energy efficient model to ensure efficient energy optimization. The proposed multi-stage clustering algorithm (referred to as DEEC-KSA) is evaluated through simulation and compared with benchmarked clustering algorithms. The result of simulation showed that the performance of DEEC-KSA is efficient among the comparative clustering algorithms for energy optimization in terms of stability period, network lifetime and network throughput. Additionally, the proposed DEEC-KSA has the optimal network running time (in seconds) to send higher number of packets to base station successfully.

In order to overcome this problem we propose mobile sink technique in cooperative MIMO based on unequal clustering. In this technique, the mobile sink are made to move back and forth along the boundary near to the base station which collects the data in its vicinity, forwards it to the base station. An alternate relay node selection scheme is also accomplished for further enhancement.

A Robust Distributed Clustered Fault-Tolerant Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks (RDCFT),https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-0047-3_8,none,conference,Springer,none,"Numerous researchers have suggested numerous solutions based on routing and energy to overcome the prevalence of WSN faults in the current literature. Clustering is the most commonly used energy-efficient and fault-tolerant management technique in WSNs, grouping sensors to manage them and perform distributed activities such as resource management. Although clustering methods are most commonly used to reduce energy consumption, they can also achieve various quality-driven goals, such as network fault tolerance capability. As a result of WSN's unpredictable nature, developing fault tolerance mechanisms is essential. Redundancy and diversity methods are commonly used in networks to increase fault tolerance. As a network management challenge, clustering methods should tolerate malfunctioning sensors while maintaining the network's coverage and stability. Sensors are prone to failure due to their operation in hostile environments with limited battery power. The state of the deployed sensor or cluster head (CH) can be active, redundant, or dead/faulty for the same target region of interest (R). The network's overall lifetime and fault tolerance capability can also be extended by using these backup sensors. By putting redundant sensors into sleep mode, can extend the network lifetime without compromising the quality of service. Sensor networks are generally designed to endure far longer than individual sensors. It is commonly performed by putting sensors to sleep. We propose a robust distributed clustered fault tolerance scheduling (RDCFT) approach that efficiently checks the status of the deployed sensor periodically (based on a sweep-line redundancy check algorithm) in WSNs.

One of the issues that needs to be addressed along with prolonging the network life time is to ensure uniform energy consumption across the network in WSNs especially in case of random network deployment. Cluster based routing algorithms are believed to be the best choice for WSNs because they work on the principle of divide and conquer and also improve the network life time considerably compared to flat based routing schemes. In this paper we propose a new routing strategy based on two layers clustering which exploits the redundancy property of the network in order to minimise duplicate data transmission and also make the intercluster and intracluster communication multihop. The proposed algorithm makes use of the nodes in a network whose area coverage is covered by the neighbouring nodes. These nodes are marked as temporary cluster heads and later use these temporary cluster heads randomly for multihop intercluster communication.

Energy efficient routing is the main challenge of the researchers in the field of wireless sensor network for a long decade. Resource constrained sensor nodes demand energy consumption as less as possible. Energy efficiency can be achieved by localization and clustering technique. Localization is used to find out the location of sensor nodes without the help of GPS and avoids broadcasting of too many messages to save energy. Event based clustering approach can reduce data redundancy in order to avoid wastage of energy. The proposed approach LAVCA has used both of the techniques in order to diminish energy consumption and increase network lifetime up to a great extent. Packet loss has also been reduced by involving an anti-void approach, called rolling ball technique. Simulation results show that the energy efficiency has been enhanced with compare to CASER, EEHC and DEEC.

They perform monitoring responsibility in all kinds of the environment including harsh environments. Thus, a stable network is required for gathering data for a long duration from the monitoring areas. This constancy of the networks depends on the load balancing among the deployed nodes. The stability of networks can be enlarged by the clustering which executes a commanding role in the effective exploitation of energy degeneracy of their batteries and assistances in extending the network lifespan. The communication among the nodes and sink is consumed the highest energy which requires a procedure that can decrease the communication cost. In this paper, we deliberate an enhanced stable election protocol for improving the lifecycle of the heterogeneous WSNs.

In this methodology, a threshold-based formula is proposed which considers a different type of energies of the networks such as current energy of the networks, and preliminary and residual energy of the nodes which provides even load balancing. The proposed method contributes a dynamic clustering to lowering energy consumption and avoiding the load over the cluster heads.

Optimized Path Selection in Oceanographic Environment,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-16681-6_50,none,conference,Springer,none,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) react to events in specified circumstances by sensing, computing and communicating with thousands of sensors arranged at different locations operating in different modes. Typical applications include, but are not limited to, data collection, military operations, surveillance, and medical telemetry. The sensors are battery powered devices and hence their lifetime is very limited. It may not be possible to recharge or replace the battery depending upon the application environment. Communication overhead has to be reduced because energy is a very valuable resource for these sensor nodes. Long distance communication among sensors will cause large amount of energy drain which may reduce the lifetime of the network. In this work we propose Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Gravitational Search based methods to address sensor network optimization problem. The GA, GSA and PSO based clustering of WSN can greatly minimize the total communication distance, thus lengthening the network lifespan. Kerala, on the west coast of India, holds a vital role in India’s fishing industry that gives a sustainable steady income. A new technique based on WSN technology using GA, GSA and PSO methods has been presented in this paper which helps to provide protection to the fishermen while they are in the deep sea. The results obtained from the proposed work shows that the network optimization based on cluster head using GSA has better performance and less energy consumption than the network without clustering.",21 May 2019,Innovations in Bio-Inspired Computing and Applications,"N.

Energy-Aware Multi-level Routing Algorithm for Two-Tier Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-04483-5_13,5,conference,Springer,none,"Cluster-based multi-hop routing is one of the proficient techniques to prolong the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this technique, a cluster head (CH) sends its data packet via other CHs to the sink. However, in most of such routing techniques, a CH selects a single path to forward the data to the sink which results in imbalance energy consumption of some of the CHs along the path and hence limits the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new distributed energy-aware multi-level routing algorithm (EMRA) to maximize the network lifetime. In the proposed algorithm, CHs are assigned various levels based on the distance between the CHs and the sink. Furthermore, a backbone network (BN) is constructed over these CHs rooted at the sink. We devise a simple and efficient technique through which each CH in the BN selects a few CHs as forwarding nodes keeping the load balancing among the CHs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing ones in terms of network lifetime.",2014,Distributed Computing and Internet Technology,"Tarachand Amgoth,Prasanta K.

A Fuzzy Based Energy Aware Unequal Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_12,7,conference,Springer,none,"One of the most important issues in wireless sensor networks is energy autonomy. Thereby wireless communication leads to excessive demands of energy. In this paper, a fuzzy based energy aware unequal clustering algorithm is presented. The network is partitioned into certain number of rings. An energy analysis model is proposed to measure the optimal radius of each cluster. This enables to vary the size of clusters from one ring to another, which ensures the load balance of the network. Then, a fuzzy logic system is employed to select suitable cluster head. The fuzzy set relies only on three parameters; residual energy, number of neighboring nodes and centrality of node among its neighbors.

In this paper, we put forward an energy-consumption model for sensors in WSNs and calculate network energy consumption in a short period for any given network configuration, including sensor state scheduling, clustering, and routing information. Then we address an energy-aware optimal planning problem with area coverage and connectivity constraints, seeking for the best sensor scheduling scheme to extend the network lifetime. We formulate it as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, and add some extra constraints to reduce the scale of the model.

An essential element of Smart Home is its sensor network to convey environment information to the control station. There have been many communication protocols for this sensor network. A problem from previous protocols is unbalanced energy consumption among sensor nodes. Even though they tried to overcome unbalanced energy consumption, they could not solve this problem completely yet. In this paper, we found that the basic reason for this unbalanced energy consumption is that there is normally one base node. Because of this architectural problem, the nodes around this sink node lose their energy more easily in relevance to other nodes. So, we propose the sensor network model with 2 and only 2 base stations with simulations, and its corresponding communication protocol.",2007,Managing Next Generation Networks and Services,"Bao Nguyen Nguyen,Deokjai Choi","(School of Electronic & Computer Engineering,Chonnam National University,Gwangju 500-757,Republic of Korea)",

In this paper a meta-heuristic optimization technique, Cuckoo Search is used to aggregate data in the Sensor Network. In the proposed technique, the least energy nodes are formed as subordinate chains (or) clusters for sensing the data and high energy nodes as Cluster Head for communicating to the base station.

There are various cluster-based protocols are available, most of the protocols consider the cluster area as a circle, hexagon, and so on, which is regular in shape. The major drawback with regular shape clusters is isolated nodes are more in the network, and the nodes may be placed at the boundary in which case the node may send the data to more than one cluster head, the data is secured both inside the cluster and across the cluster in which case the energy consumptions are more. The proposed protocol shows that the clusters of irregular shapes, with ideal distance and securing the data only across the cluster, can improve the lifetime of the nodes in the networks.",04 October 2017,Sensors and Image Processing," Shashikala,C.

The WSN test bed is made up of a number of Mica2 motes with fixed and know locations and equipped with light sensors. To reduce the overload of communications, power consumption, and allow for scalability, the network is divided into clusters, where members of each cluster communicate with the designated cluster head, which in turn communicates with a sink or another cluster head. When the RCV moves within the motes, a mote in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle becomes ‘hot’, i.e., its intensity exceeds a predetermined threshold, and it relays to its cluster head its ID and the intensity of its reading. The cluster head, in turns, establishes the location of ‘hottest’ mote, and uses this information to dynamically update the new location of the vehicle along with its velocity and acceleration.",2010,Ad Hoc Networks,"Fernand S.

In an IoT network, there can be an overwhelming number of massively connected devices, all of which must be able to communicate to each other with low latency to provide a positive user experience. Various protocols exist to allow for this connectivity, and are vulnerable to attack due to their simple nature. These attacks seek to disrupt or deny communications in the network by taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. These attacks include Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding and Scheduling attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to prevent these routing attacks exist, and have begun to incorporate Deep Learning (DL) to bring near perfect accuracy of detection of attackers. The DL approach opens up the IDS to the possibility of being the victim of an Adversarial Machine Learning attack. We explore the case of a novel evasion attack applied to a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) dataset for subversion of the IDS. Additionally, we explore possible mitigations for the proposed evasion attack, through adversarial example training, outlier detection, and a combination of the two. By using the combination, we are able to reduce the possible attack space by nearly two orders of magnitude.",23 March 2022,Machine Learning for Networking,"Nicholas Lurski,Nicholas Lurski,Mohamed Younis","(Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Laurel,MD,20723,USA),(University of Maryland,Baltimore County,Baltimore,Maryland,21250,USA)",
