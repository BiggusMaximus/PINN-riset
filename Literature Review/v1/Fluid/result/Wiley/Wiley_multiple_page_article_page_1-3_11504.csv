In MW-LEACH, they select the cluster heads (CHs) based on the residual energy, the distances between the CHs, and an optimal number of member nodes. The nodes are selected from the initial set based on the high residual energy closer to the centre of the density, thus forming an initial set of CH candidates. The candidates then move in different directions to collect data from their members sending it to the base station. The proposed approach has lower complexity in terms of time and message.

ETH-LEACH: An energy enhanced threshold routing protocol for WSNs,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4881,15,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"clustering,energy consumption,network lifetime,node ranking,wireless sensor network","Many wireless sensor-based applications use LEACH as a preferred routing protocol owing to its unique features such as optimal sleeping time, minimum packet collisions, dynamic channel selection, and least power consumption. The traditional LEACH protocol wastes the transmission opportunities as it processes data only in an event occurring, leading to wastage of resources. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes a more robust Energy Enhanced Threshold Routing Protocol (ETH-LEACH) for WSNs. The working of ETH-LEACH is conceptualized in two parts. In the first part, TDMA is implemented to estimate the opportunistic paths to remove network overhead. Furthermore, in the second part, a threshold value is calculated for choosing the forwarder nodes. The proposed technique minimizes the energy usage of the sensor nodes and consequently enhances the network's lifetime by extending the duration of node death. The ETH-LEACH protocol is contrasted with the different variants of LEACH to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed ETH-LEACH protocol outperforms the traditional routing protocols.

However, the increase in IoT-enabled gadgets, particularly those running on batteries or connected to other sources, is putting strain on the world's energy requirements. Therefore, this study focuses on a green routing solution for battery-powered IoT-enabled Software-defined Wireless Sensor Networks (IoT-SDWSN). Finding green solutions for IoT-based networks to address this energy challenge has become crucial. This study focuses on developing a green routing solution for battery-powered IoT-SDWSN. Energy efficiency in IoT-SDWSN is attained by the process of clustering nodes. The network is partitioned into small clusters, and a Control Node (CN) is set up by a Control Server (CS) to transmit the data packets sent by sensor nodes. Choosing a CN in these networks is a critical concern due to the substantial energy consumption involved in delivering data to the CS.

In this phase, the base station utilizes the GSMO algorithm as a device to generate energy-efficient clusters. Followed with this, the steady-state phase solves the load balancing issue by utilizing the intracluster data broadcast and dual-hop intercluster broadcasting algorithm. Thereby, the proposed EGSMRP protocol has shown the energy-based opportunistic broadcasting with reduced control overhead. Simulation is performed in various conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EGSMRP protocol using different metrics such as throughput, control overhead, energy consumption, end-to-end delay, and network lifetime.

Issues involved with the use of a sensor network are energy-saving and the effective use of energy. Clustering in WSNs is a proven technique for energy optimization. The relationship between sensor nodes and cluster heads (CHs) has only been considered prior to cluster-based routing protocols. However, most clustering algorithms have failed to address the routing overhead and the energy consumption rate between CH nodes and SINK.

The cluster members send the collected data towards their respective CHs for aggregation. To find the sink's best position, the PSO-GA-based location estimation algorithm is initiated based on the network structure. The limited capability of WSNs makes them more vulnerable to attackers. The prevention mechanism must be less complex to ensure the fair operations in the network. Here, the attack detection ability of the proposed solution has been tested against clone attack.

Each GH gathers readings from sensors within its group and processes the data to detect possible phenomena within its geographical boundaries. Then, GHs communicate with each other to discover and report global phenomena. To further reduce the energy cost, the study proposes three optimisation strategies: the first strategy, reporting by partial participation (RPP), limits the number of participating GHs in reporting the phenomena. RPP achieved a saving in the energy cost of around 50%. The second strategy, reporting by Z-order (RZO), provides an overall short communication path between GHs by using Z-order.

These approaches split the sensor nodes into clusters, in which each cluster consists of an exclusive cluster head (CH) node. The major scope of this task is to introduce a novel CH selection in WSN applicable to IoT using the self-adaptive meta-heuristic algorithm. This paper aids in providing the optimal routing in the network based on direct node (DN) selection, CH selection, and clone cluster head (CCH) selection. DNs are located near the base station, and it is chosen to avoid the load of CH. The adoption of the novel self-adaptive coyote optimization algorithm (SA-COA) is used for the DN selection and CCH selection. When the nodes are assigned in the network, DN and CCH selection is performed by the proposed SA-COA. Then, the computation of residual energy helps to select the CH, by correlating with the threshold energy. CCH is proposed to copy the data from the CH to avoid the loss of data in transmitting. By forming the CCH, the next CH can be easily elected with the optimal CCH using SA-COA.

The selected information then is sent to a base station (BS) to be sent to cloud server for further processing. Since the energy of sensor nodes is limited, the most significant challenge in these networks is reducing the energy consumption of the network. It is proved that dividing the network to clusters can significantly reduce the energy consumption. One of the most popular clustering protocols in WSNs is the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH). In this protocol, cluster heads (CHs) are selected randomly which results in poor performance in real scenarios. In this article, a new energy aware CH selection algorithm is proposed which selects CHs based on the residual energy, the position and centrality of nodes. It uses a variable range upon which the centrality and the number of neighbours of each node are calculated.

WSNs need to use protocols for transmitting data samples from event regions to sink through minimum cost links. Clustering is a commonly used method of data aggregation in which nodes are organized into groups to reduce energy consumption. Nonetheless, cluster head (CH) has to bear an additional load in clustering protocols to organize different activities within the cluster. Proper CH selection and load balancing using efficient routing protocol is therefore a critical aspect for WSN's long-term operation. In this paper, a threshold-sensitive energy-efficient cluster-based routing protocol based on flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is proposed to extend the network's stability period.

Self-adaptive MAC protocol was working upon reinforcement learning. However, this decentralized adaptive scheduling introduces collisions and degrades the overall network performance. To fix this problem, this paper proposes novel semi-synchronized MAC approach for energy harvesting WSN. The major objective of this work is to improve energy efficiency of the network by minimizing energy consumption which is the major issue in WSN. Proposed WSN network is modeled with dual mobile sinks with circular moving path and static sensor nodes to monitor the environment.

Before route selection, all candidate nodes are regarded into perfect match, partially match, and no match nodes. Furthermore, emergency data is identified by CH based on flag value and transmitted without any time delay. For emergency data transmission, extremity aware routing (EAR) algorithm is presented and EAR algorithm is functioning on hopcount and distance criteria.

Since these protocols address the reasons for energy loss in one layer and neglect the treatment of energy loss in other layers, as each layer of the TCP/IP module has its own features and has no control over the other layers. Therefore, there was a need for a cross-layer design. In this paper, an energy-efficient cross-layer between MAC layer and network layer has been proposed using slotted ALOHA based p-persistent CSMA MAC protocol and Enhance Energy Conservation based on Residual Energy and Distance (EECRED) in order to reduce energy consumption and increase the network lifetime. The performance of the proposed cross-layer protocol is evaluated by simulating the protocol using the MATLAB simulation.

These networks consist of thousands of small-sized battery-operated devices called sensors. Sensors are resource-constrained devices, and hence have very limited energy available with them. By lessening the energy usage of these nodes, the life span of the whole network can be enhanced up to a great extent. Clustering of WSNs is a speedily flourishing research area. In clustered WSNs, the major concerns are choosing an appropriate number of clusters and then selecting a coordinator node called cluster head (CH) within each formed cluster. This study introduces a hybrid energy-efficient clustering based on fuzzy C means and differential evolution algorithm (EEFCM-DE) based on fuzzy clustering and fuzzy-based evolutionary technique. The idea is to use FCM for the cluster creation and then selecting the best node as a CH within each cluster formed, by using an evolutionary technique DE.

However, this rapid growth has undoubtedly led to raised energy consumption, which, in turn, has raised significant concerns about the environment. Consequently, there is a growing demand for green computing techniques that can mitigate IoT device's energy usage and carbon footprint. Clustering IoT networks is a useful strategy for extending their lifespan. However, clustering presents a complex optimization problem that falls under the category of NP-hard; hence making it a challenging issue. Nevertheless, using meta-heuristics algorithms has greatly improved our ability to tackle such challenges.

The proposed protocol, namely Broadcast over Duty-Cycle and LEACH (BOD-LEACH), takes advantage of the LEACH's energy-efficient clustering. This approach shifts the total burden of energy consumption of a single cluster head by rotating the cluster-head role among all nodes in the network. It also permits the ordinary (member) nodes in a cluster to turn off their radios whenever they enter inactive TDMA slots. However, LEACH does not consider broadcast messages, and the member nodes scheduling is established as a sequence of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) without any common active period. A broadcast message should then be postponed to the next TDMA schedule and transmitted in a sequence of unicast messages, which is inefficient in terms of latency, bandwidth occupation, and power consumption. The proposed protocol adds new common static and dynamic broadcast periods to support and accelerate broadcasting. The dynamic periods are scheduled following the past arrivals of messages and using a Markov chain model. To our knowledge, this work is the first that proposes the use of clustering to perform simultaneous local broadcasts at several clusters. This reduces broadcast latency and ensures scalability. The protocol has been simulated, numerically analyzed, and compared with LEACH. The results show clear improvement over LEACH with regard to broadcast latency, at a low energy cost.

In the protocol, nodes consume less energy when transmitting data, which improves the network lifetime. The proposed protocol selects the cluster heads (CHs) on the bases of degree, temperature, and energy to perform routing. Moreover, for solving the issue of a single point of failure, the blockchain is utilized. The data transactions are also housed in the blockchain, which is deployed on the CHs and BSs, as, in blockchain, multiple nodes take part. Therefore, to perform a consensus between them, a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used in the underlying work. In the blockchain, the secure hashing algorithm-256 (SHA-256) is used for secure hashing of data transactions. Furthermore, malicious nodes are detected during the routing using the real-time message content validation (RMCV) scheme in the ETD-LEACH protocol. The proposed model is evaluated under the denial-of-service (DoS) attack, the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and the smart contract analysis performed by the Oyente tool. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through simulations. The ETD-LEACH and energy threshold-low energy-adaptive clustering hierarchy (ETH-LEACH) protocols are compared using different parameters like number of alive nodes, energy consumption, throughput, and delay. ETD-LEACH consumes less energy and has a better network lifetime as compared to ETH-LEACH. In addition, the RMCV-ETD-LEACH network performance is better than that of both DoS-ETD-LEACH and MITM-ETD-LEACH. Moreover, PoA transaction cost is less than that of proof of work.

The deployment of security algorithms can monitor only the unauthorized signals to ensure security, but it lacks and leads to higher energy consumption, whereas the deployment of energy-efficient routing algorithms is used only for the selection of routing paths, but it fails to ensure security. Hence, the main intent of this research work is to solve both problems by the following proposed models. Model 1 is “Identity-Based Aggregate Signatures (IBAS)” that is the most effective security-based framework protocol in this research work. Model 2 is the integration of IBAS and “Fuzzy Logic System (FLS)” that acts as an energy-efficient algorithm, and here, FLS is used to find the optimal path from source to destination to transmit the data. Model 3 is the combination of IBAS and the “Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)” for higher energy efficiency and auto localization by analyzing the entire route in WSN. Model 4 is the combination of IBAS, WOA, and the “Reinforcement Theory of WOA (RTWOA)” energy-efficiency model with a twofold and weight factor strategy for better speed and accuracy. These models ensure security, energy efficiency, and auto localization.

The battery power of sensor nodes is limited due to which their efficient utilization is much necessary as the battery is irreplaceable. Efficient energy utilization is addressed as one of the important issues by many researchers recently in WSN. Clustering is one of the fundamental approaches used for efficient energy utilization in WSNs. The clustering method should be effective for the selection of optimal clusters with efficient energy consumption. Extensive modification in the clustering approaches leads to an increase in the lifetime of sensor nodes which is a unique way for network lifetime enhancement. As the technologies were taken to next the level where multiparameters need to be considered in almost every application in clustering, multiple factors affect the clustering and these factors were conflicting in nature too. Due to the conflicting nature of these factors, it becomes difficult to coordinate among them for optimized clustering. In this paper, we have considered multiattributes and made coordination among these attributes for optimal cluster head selection. We have considered Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods for CH’s selection from the available alternatives by making suitable coordination among these attributes, and comparative analysis has been taken in LEACH, LEACH-C, EECS, HEED, HEEC, and DEECET algorithms.

The performance of the proposed CZSEP was compared to that of the conventional ZSEP considering the same total initial energy. To further improve the performance of CZSEP, they propose the second protocol named as, CZSEP with helper nodes (CZSEP-HN) which is a three-level heterogeneous energy protocol.

The ring routing protocol is an energy-proficient mobile sink routing protocol that can be easily accessible and configures based on the virtual ring composition. Moreover, ring routing is a hierarchical routing protocol with a mobile sink in WSN that uses greedy geographic routing. In this research work, an energy-aware ring routing protocol is developed based on the defined multi-objective.

Security threats to WSNs are gradually being expanded. Thus, to improve the network’s performance, detection of anomalies (malicious and suspicious nodes, redundant data, bad connections, etc.) is important. This paper is aimed at introducing the malicious node detection algorithm based on the DBSCAN algorithm, which is a density-based unsupervised learning method for enabling wireless sensor networks to be much more secure and reliable.

Therefore, it is urgent to study the suitable routing technology of observation instrument networks according to the characteristics of cold and arid areas. In this paper, we have studied and designed an improved routing protocol for the field observation instruments network based on the LEACH protocol (FOI-LEACH). Firstly, the FOI-LEACH was proposed to mainly improve the LEACH protocol in three aspects: (1) the network nodes are heterogeneous and combined with the characteristics of field observation instrument networking. The residual energy and the rechargeable energy of nodes are added in the process of cluster head (CH) election to reduce the risk of premature death of CHs and shortened network life cycle caused by the selection of nodes with less energy as CH. (2) In the process of cluster forming, the distance from CH to the base station (BS) and the residual energy of CH is considered when setting the cluster radius, to reasonably plan the cluster size and alleviate the “hot spot” problem. The nonuniform distribution of clusters in the network is enhanced to balance the total network energy consumption. (3) The autonomous zone-based multihop routing mechanism is adopted to solve the low reliability of data transmission caused by the poor quality of intercluster communication links and premature death of nodes in long-distance transmission. Then, MATLAB was used to compare the network routing protocol model of the observation instrument from four aspects, network life, energy consumption rate, stability, and throughput.

Since MANET is a decentralized system, it poses to the exploitation of energy during the reliable path selection during routing. Hence, selection of protocol plays a major aspect in MANET for combatting against the energy depletion of nodes, Instable link, mobility character, and load balancing. The RPS-LEACH protocol is proposed in this paper for the efficient path selection by organizing the nodes into clusters. For each cluster, Cluster Head (CH) is elected based on its strong transmission power and battery life. The Cluster Members (CM) is organized, respectively, based on its ability to respond to its cluster head REQs. Mainly, RPS values are calculated by the two parameters such as (i) successful interactions and (ii) unsuccessful interactions. In the proposed system, RPS (Reliable Path Selection) values are exchanged among the nodes for the reliable path selection by choosing the highest RPS value node for its communication. Hence, by adopting the RPS scheme, the nodes are able to choose the most reliable path for the efficient data transfer by exchanging the RPS values by ignoring the paths that consuming long time to transfer the data. In this procedure, correspondence convention, which comprises imperative impact of vitality liberality of such networks, is addressed.

As a result, they cannot take full advantage of the presence of node heterogeneity. In this study, a stable and energy-efficient clustering (SEEC) protocol for heterogeneous WSNs is proposed. In addition, the extension to multi-level of SEEC is presented. It depends on the network structure that is divided into clusters. Each cluster has a powerful advanced node and some normal nodes deployed randomly in this cluster. In the multi-level architectures, more powerful supper nodes are assigned to cover distant sensing areas. Each type of nodes has its role in the sensing, aggregation or transmission to the base station. At each level of heterogeneity, the optimum number of powerful nodes that achieves the minimum energy consumption of the network is obtained. The proposed protocol is a heterogeneous awareness to prolong the stability period, which is crucial for many applications.

It is important to reduce energy consumption in WSNs to extend network life, since it is usually impossible to replace sensor batteries. In this paper, a novel clustering and routing method is proposed. It is mainly based on genetic algorithms and equilibrium optimization. To improve scalability, the sensor nodes are clustered in the first phase using the genetic algorithm and then the best cluster heads are selected. It follows by the next step, where each node sends its collected data to the cluster head. The cluster heads first aggregate the received data and then use a multihop optimization routing algorithm by the new equilibrium optimization algorithm to send the data to the base station. Specifically, the main contribution of this work is to reduce energy consumption in WSN using a genetic algorithm for clustering and an equilibrium optimization algorithm for choosing the path between the cluster heads and the base station.

To resolve this, cluster-based topology is adapted by the various researchers for rendering green energy-efficient solution for communication of IoT devices. In this paper, the dynamic and energy-efficient clustering for energy hole mitigation (DECEM) is proposed.

First, the GN is selected in each side of the network (divided into two halves), and later, clustering is done, and selection of two CHs in each cluster is performed. The parameters for the selection of GN and CHs include residual energy, separation between the node and the sink, the number of neighbour nodes and network's residual energy.

However, malicious node outbreaks will occur, which exaggerate the functions of WSNs during the routing procedure. A secure routing protocol is necessary to protect the effectiveness of WSN and routing fortification. In real-time scenarios, the existing routing protocol is volatile dynamically; it makes difficult to identify the performance of unprotected routing nodes. In this manuscript, a unique routing strategy is proposed for secured dynamic optimal routing (SDOR) in WSN that combines block chain technology optimized with a generative adversarial capsule network. Every routing sensor node contains a secret key, which is used to construct a crypto hash signature (CHS) token for flow access. The proposed block chain-based WSN is used to provide SDOR information using a self-attention-based generative adversarial capsule network that is improved using the flamingo search algorithm. Following that, the security on the proposed block chain WSN is assessed from six angles. Block chain token transactions are evaluated using measures including average latency, average energy usage, and throughput.

Minimizing the energy dissipation and maximizing the network lifetime is an important design issue in WSN. Clustering is the widely used energy effective technique to lessen the overall energy consumption of WSN. An appropriate selection of cluster heads (CHs) and cluster size is a crucial process in clustered WSN. The CHs nearer to base station (BS) suffer from hot spot problem and die earlier than the normal lifetime. This paper contributes a five input fuzzy-based unequal clustering protocol (F5NUCP) for selecting CHs and determining the appropriate cluster size to prevent the network from hot spot problem. Unequal clusters eliminates the hot spot problem by producing smaller clusters for the nodes located near the BS and larger clusters for the nodes located far away from the BS. F5NUCP uses a nonprobabilistic approach for selecting tentative CHs by introducing a back-off timer where the timer value is set using the remaining energy of the node. The proposed method uses five input parameters, namely, remaining energy, distance to BS, distance to its neighboring nodes, link quality, and node degree. The output fuzzy parameters used in this research are cluster size and the probability of becoming CHs. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB.

Its execution process is cyclical. Each cycle is divided into two phases: cluster building phase and stable data communication phase. In the stage of cluster building, the adjacent nodes cluster dynamically and randomly generate cluster heads. In the data communication phase, the nodes in the cluster send the data to the cluster head, and the cluster head performs data fusion and sends the results to the aggregation node. Because the cluster head needs to complete data fusion, communication with the convergence node and other works, the energy consumption is large. Leach algorithm can ensure that each node acts as cluster head with equal probability, so that the nodes in the network consume energy relatively evenly. The basic idea of Leach algorithm is to randomly select cluster head nodes in a circular way. It evenly distributes the energy load of the whole network to each sensor node in the network. It can reduce network energy consumption and improve network life cycle. Leach repeatedly performs cluster refactoring during its operation.

Design of a novel degree load-balanced and fuzzy ant colony optimization protocol for optimizing the clustering architecture in WSN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.4997,2,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,"ACO,balanced,clustered,hierarchical routing,sensor network","A sensor network is a situation-based critical network defined under certain restrictions and constraints. The clustered architecture is defined over these networks to utilize the criticality vectors and to improve network communication. In this paper, a degree load-balanced and fuzzy-ACO (DLB-fACO) protocol is proposed for optimizing the clustered architecture. In this architecture, the load analysis is performed while forming the clusters. The cluster head selection is performed based on energy, cluster density, and probability vector. The node degree- and energy-balanced analysis is performed for identifying the cluster members. Once the clusters are formed, the ACO approach is applied to perform the cluster-based hierarchical routing. Communication is performed at two levels. In the first level, node-to-cluster head communication is performed by considering energy and degree consideration. In the second level, the fuzzy-integrated ACO method is applied for inter-cluster route formation. The route optimization is here performed under fuzzy-based energy, degree, and distance parameters. These fuzzy parameters are evaluated within the ACO algorithm for generating the optimized route. The proposed load-balanced protocol is analyzed against the LEACH, LEACH-C, LEACH-CC, M-LEACH, Fuzzy-PSO, Fuzzy-ACO, Fuzzy-Cuckoo, and FMCB-ER protocols. The experimentation results confirm the significant gain in network lifetime and packet communication. The cluster count, clustering switching, and communication failure are also reduced in comparison with existing conventional and optimized protocols.",10 October 2021,International Journal of Communication Systems,"Kapil Juneja,","(Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology SGT University Gurugram India),",India
A Distributed Unequal Clustering Routing Protocol Based on the Improved Sine Cosine Algorithm for WSN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/7382098,2,Research Article,Wiley,,"In order to balance the overall energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of wireless sensor network (WSN), a distributed energy-balanced unequal clustering routing protocol based on the improved sine cosine algorithm (DUCISCA) is proposed. Firstly, DUCISCA adopts a time-based cluster head competition algorithm. In this algorithm, the broadcast time depends on the residual energy of the candidate cluster head, the distance to the base station, and the number of neighbour nodes. Secondly, a competition radius considering the distance from node to base station and the residual energy of node is proposed. It can balance energy consumption of nodes in different locations to avoid the “hot spot” problem. At the same time, it adopts a time-based broadcast mechanism. The waiting time depends on the residual energy of CCHs, the distance to the BS, and the number of neighbour nodes, which can effectively reduce the overhead of nodes. Thirdly, the energy of cluster head, the number of neighbour nodes, and the distance from the ordinary node to the cluster heads need to be taken into account to get a better clustering result. Finally, in order to speed up convergence and improve the ability to jump out of local optimum, the improved sine-cosine algorithm (ISCA) based on Latin hypercube sampling and adaptive mutation is proposed. The improvement strategies adopted by ISCA are expressed as follows: Firstly, the diversity of the population is enhanced through LHS population initialization. Secondly, the adaptive weight strategy is introduced to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the population is disturbed by Gaussian mutation or Levy flight to jump out of the local optimum. The standard deviation of cluster heads’ residual energy in intercluster communication is taken as the objective function to search the energy-balanced intercluster data forwarding path based on ISCA. Compared with EEUC, DEBUC, I-EEUC, and M-DEBUC, the simulation results prove that DUCISCA can effectively balance the overall network energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime.",23 February 2022,Journal of Sensors,"Fang Zhu,Wenhao Wang,","(School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao 066004, China neuq.edu.cn),(School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao 066004, China neuq.edu.cn),","China,China"
