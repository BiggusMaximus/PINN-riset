"Modeling Shear Wave Propagation in an Incompressible, Transversely Isotropic Material Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9958579/,2,Conference Paper,IEEE,"physics-informed neural networks,transverse isotropy,shear wave elastography,skeletal muscle","There is increasing interest in using ultrasound shear wave elasticity imaging to study tissues described as incompressible, transversely isotropic (ITI) materials, such as skeletal muscle. In silico modeling helps us predict and understand shear wave behavior in complex materials like the ITI model, which supports two shear polarizations with different, direction-dependent propagation speeds. Existing techniques, the finite element method (FEM) and Greens functions, are computationally expensive and generate large file sizes. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is a relatively novel technique to solve partial differential equations and produces solutions that are compressed, analytic, and free of space-time discretization. Here, we solve the 3D wave equation for an ITI material using PINNs and show that solutions match FEM simulations to first order for material parameters based on skeletal muscle. Estimated shear wave speeds for the PINN and FEM solutions differed by an average of 4.7%. Unlike the FEM simulation, the PINN solution had no reflection artifacts at the boundaries. Second-order differences in frequency content and amplitude distribution suggest the need for further validation. PINNs can enable rapid exploration of the complex shear wave behavior in ITI materials and can be extended to different material models by adjusting the wave equation and initial conditions.", 01 December 2022 ,2022 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),"Felix Q.

However, they encounter challenges in accurately predicting the high-frequency wavefields, known as the spectral bias problem. Based on the previously used frequency upscaling (FU) and neuron splitting (NS) concepts to help with the high frequency wavefields, we present a sequence of strategies [i.e., multiscale Fourier feature mapping (MFFM), frequency transferring (FT), a revised NS (RNS), and denser sampling (DS)] to overcome the spectral bias challenge of PINN in solving the frequency-domain acoustic wave equation. MFFM projects PINN inputs onto sinusoids with off-axis frequency distributions, characterizing the PINN wavefield by a Fourier decomposition. FT initializes the NN for higher frequency (e.g., 16 Hz) using the pretrained NN for the nearest lower frequency (e.g., 15 Hz), which is refined from FU (where the 16 Hz NN is initialized by that of 8 Hz). Thus, we show that FT is more effective than FU. We also introduce RNS, which is a modified strategy derived from NS by adding a small amount of random noise, drawn from a uniform distribution, to the replicated weights/biases to break the symmetry after replication, improving the NN’s representational capacity. Because MFFM, FT, and RNS alone are inadequate for generating high-frequency wavefields, we further develop DS to use a smaller spatial sampling interval within the same computational domain (the wavefield is more continuous and smoother).

In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method. The spatial variation of elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been introduced in the governing equations, which are encoded in SWENet as loss functions. Snapshots of wave motions have been used to train neural networks, and during this course, the elastic properties within a region of interest illuminated by shear waves are inferred simultaneously. We performed finite element simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, and ex vivo experiments to validate the method. Our results show that the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or irregular geometries can be identified with excellent accuracy. The advantages of the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the wave motions and enabling seamless integration of multi-source data in the inverse analysis.

When simulating wave behavior, one difficulty that is often encountered is wave reflections, which can lead to numerical oscillations especially on grids with complex geometries. In this research, we investigated if a neural network can accurately model wave behavior when extensive reflections are involved. If proven true, such a neural network would be very useful, as neural networks are amongst the fastest techniques for solving mathematical models. To test this idea, we trained a neural network to simulate the shallow water equations on a grid where the right boundary is fitted to a 5 point, 8 point, or 11 point spline. The simulation scenario called for a wave to be given an initial velocity in the right direction, causing it to impinge upon and then reflect off of the right boundary. To make the task even more difficult, we allowed the initial wave location to be a random point on the grid. Our training methodology involved both supervised learning with sample data points and unsupervised learning with the residuals of the shallow water equations acting as a loss function. Throughout the course of five experiments, the neural network learned to model wave reflection with a mean squared error of 9.7797E-06 for the simplest scenario and 1.6595E-05 for the most complex scenario.

The improved PINNs not only embed the constraints of PDEs, but also add the constraints of gradient information, thus further enriching the physical constraints of the neural network model. In addition, the weight coefficients of the loss function are updated by an adaptive learning method to dynamically adjust the proportion of each constraint term in the loss function to speed up the training speed.

Reconstruction of the S-Wave Velocity via Mixture Density Networks With a New Rayleigh Wave Dispersion Function,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9761265/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,"Inverse problems,machine learning,mixture density network (MDN),Rayleigh wave dispersion","How to determine the velocity of an S-wave from measured seismic data is an important topic in seismology. A modern technique for obtaining the S-wave velocity is to solve an inverse problem so that the simulated dispersion curve (the relation between the frequencies and phase velocities) coincides with the actual experimental results. In this work, by using the seismic impedance tensor, we propose a new function describing Rayleigh wave dispersion in the layered medium model of the Earth, which offers an efficient way to compute the dispersion curve. With this newly established forward model, based on mixture density networks (MDNs), we develop a physics-informed neural network, named MDN based on a physics informed forward model (FW-MDN), to estimate the S-wave velocity from dispersion curves. The FW-MDN method deals with the nonuniqueness issue encountered in the inversion of dispersion curves for the crust and upper mantle models, and attains satisfactory performance on an artificial dataset with various noise structures. Numerical simulations are performed to show that the FW-MDN offers easy calculation, efficient computation, and high precision for model characterization.",Date of Publication: 21 April 2022 ,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"Jianxun Yang,Chen Xu,Ye Zhang","(Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, Shenzhen, China),(Department of Engineering, Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, Shenzhen, China),(School of Mathematics and Statistics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China)","China,China,China"

Modeling of the Forward Wave Propagation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9593574/,11,Conference Paper,IEEE,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks,Wave Equation,Forward Problem,Numerical Modelling","Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used in modeling problems in nature and are commonly solved using classical methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method (FVM), or Finite Difference Method (FDM). However, solving high-dimensional PDEs has been notoriously difficult due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD). Among the pool of hyperbolic PDEs, the wave equation in particular is the base for modeling various clinical applications and designing many solutions in the medical fields of therapeutic and diagnostic ultrasound. This draws attention to the importance of accurate and efficient simulation. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed to predict numerical solutions of PDEs. Within that context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have surfaced as a powerful tool for modeling PDEs. We simulate a linear wave equation with a single time-dependent sinusoidal source function e.g.: sin (π t) using PINNs to model one of the most fundamental modeling equations in medical ultrasound applications.

SWENet: A Physics-Informed Deep Neural Network (PINN) for Shear Wave Elastography,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336831/,3,Journal Article,IEEE,"Shear wave elastography,deep learning,physics-informed neural network,inverse problem,phantom and ex vivo experiments,tumor biomechanics","Shear wave elastography (SWE) enables the measurement of elastic properties of soft materials in a non-invasive manner and finds broad applications in various disciplines. The state-of-the-art SWE methods rely on the measurement of local shear wave speeds to infer material parameters and suffer from wave diffraction when applied to soft materials with strong heterogeneity. In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method. The spatial variation of elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been introduced in the governing equations, which are encoded in SWENet as loss functions. Snapshots of wave motions have been used to train neural networks, and during this course, the elastic properties within a region of interest illuminated by shear waves are inferred simultaneously. We performed finite element simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, and ex vivo experiments to validate the method. Our results show that the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or irregular geometries can be identified with excellent accuracy. The advantages of the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the wave motions and enabling seamless integration of multi-source data in the inverse analysis. Given the advantages of SWENet, it may find broad applications where full wave fields get involved to infer heterogeneous mechanical properties, such as identifying small solid tumors with ultrasound SWE, and differentiating gray and white matters of the brain with magnetic resonance elastography.",Date of Publication: 30 November 2023 ,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,"Ziying Yin,Guo-Yang Li,Zhaoyi Zhang,Yang Zheng,Yanping Cao,Ziying Yin,Guo-Yang Li,Zhaoyi Zhang,Yang Zheng,Yanping Cao","(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Harvard Medical School and the Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USACollege of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Harvard Medical School and the Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USACollege of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China),(Department of Engineering Mechanics, Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, AML, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China)","China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China"

Currently, the training of PINN is usually constructed by fixed points in seismic wavefield simulation, and the large number of training points can result in high-computational costs. This letter proposes an adaptive strategy for PINN training point selection based on the velocity distribution and residuals of viscoacoustic wave equations.

The state-of-the-art SWE methods rely on the measurement of local shear wave speeds to infer material parameters and suffer from wave diffraction when applied to soft materials with strong heterogeneity. In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method. The spatial variation of elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been introduced in the governing equations, which are encoded in SWENet as loss functions. Snapshots of wave motions have been used to train neural networks, and during this course, the elastic properties within a region of interest illuminated by shear waves are inferred simultaneously. We performed finite element simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, and ex vivo experiments to validate the method. Our results show that the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or irregular geometries can be identified with excellent accuracy. The advantages of the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the wave motions and enabling seamless integration of multi-source data in the inverse analysis.

Physics Informed Neural Network for Solving the Shallow Water Equations on Grids of Arbitrary Geometry,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500298/,none,Conference Paper,IEEE,"physics informed neural networks,shallow water equations,finite difference method,arbitrary geometry,finite dimensions,deep learning","Many physical phenomena exhibit wave behavior, including fluids, acoustics, and electromagnetics. When simulating wave behavior, one difficulty that is often encountered is wave reflections, which can lead to numerical oscillations especially on grids with complex geometries. In this research, we investigated if a neural network can accurately model wave behavior when extensive reflections are involved. If proven true, such a neural network would be very useful, as neural networks are amongst the fastest techniques for solving mathematical models. To test this idea, we trained a neural network to simulate the shallow water equations on a grid where the right boundary is fitted to a 5 point, 8 point, or 11 point spline. The simulation scenario called for a wave to be given an initial velocity in the right direction, causing it to impinge upon and then reflect off of the right boundary. To make the task even more difficult, we allowed the initial wave location to be a random point on the grid. Our training methodology involved both supervised learning with sample data points and unsupervised learning with the residuals of the shallow water equations acting as a loss function. Throughout the course of five experiments, the neural network learned to model wave reflection with a mean squared error of 9.7797E-06 for the simplest scenario and 1.6595E-05 for the most complex scenario. We have proven that a neural network is capable of learning wave behavior with reflections, with applications in computational acoustics to the modeling of detonation wave reflections.", 24 April 2024 ,SoutheastCon 2024,"Hannah Cho,Hannah Cho","(Pacific Academy, Tustin, CA, USA),(Pacific Academy, Tustin, CA, USA)",
