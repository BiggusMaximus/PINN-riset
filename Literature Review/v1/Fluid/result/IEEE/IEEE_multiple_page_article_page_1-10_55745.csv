"Modeling Shear Wave Propagation in an Incompressible, Transversely Isotropic Material Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9958579/,2,Conference Paper,IEEE,"physics-informed neural networks,transverse isotropy,shear wave elastography,skeletal muscle","There is increasing interest in using ultrasound shear wave elasticity imaging to study tissues described as incompressible, transversely isotropic (ITI) materials, such as skeletal muscle. In silico modeling helps us predict and understand shear wave behavior in complex materials like the ITI model, which supports two shear polarizations with different, direction-dependent propagation speeds. Existing techniques, the finite element method (FEM) and Greens functions, are computationally expensive and generate large file sizes. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is a relatively novel technique to solve partial differential equations and produces solutions that are compressed, analytic, and free of space-time discretization. Here, we solve the 3D wave equation for an ITI material using PINNs and show that solutions match FEM simulations to first order for material parameters based on skeletal muscle. Estimated shear wave speeds for the PINN and FEM solutions differed by an average of 4.7%. Unlike the FEM simulation, the PINN solution had no reflection artifacts at the boundaries. Second-order differences in frequency content and amplitude distribution suggest the need for further validation. PINNs can enable rapid exploration of the complex shear wave behavior in ITI materials and can be extended to different material models by adjusting the wave equation and initial conditions.", 01 December 2022 ,2022 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),"Felix Q.

Numerical Solver-Independent Seismic Wave Simulation Using Task-Decomposed Physics-Informed Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229173/,3,Journal Article,IEEE,"Acoustic wave equation modeling,numerical solver independent,physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),task-decomposed strategy","Solving the wave equation is an essential step in the simulation of seismic wavefields. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied in geophysics. However, there are still some challenges in solving the time-domain wave equation due to the complexity of seismic wavefields and the point source singularity. Numerical solutions can be used as initial conditions (ICs) to constrain the network training. However, numerical solver-assisted methods have their own accuracy and stability limitations. We propose to use the analytical solutions of the wave equation as prior knowledge. This method does not rely on numerical solvers of the wave equation. It avoids the point source singularity by using analytical wavefields as ICs. In addition, we tackle the issue of balancing different terms in the loss function by proposing task-decomposed PINNs (TD-PINNs). TD-PINNs divide network training into three steps, including pretraining, full learning, and physics-enhanced training. The performance of TD-PINNs to solve the wave equation has been tested in different models, and the results show that it can simulate seismic wave propagation with reasonable accuracy.",Date of Publication: 24 August 2023 ,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,"Jingbo Zou,Cai Liu,Chao Song,Pengfei Zhao,Jingbo Zou,Cai Liu,Chao Song,Pengfei Zhao","(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China),(Department of Geophysics, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China)","China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China"
Physics-informed neural networks for modeling acoustic radiation force-induced shear wave propagation and the reconstruction of material parameters from observations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308026/,none,Conference Paper,IEEE,"Shear Wave Elastography,Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse,Transverse Isotropy,Physics-Informed Neural Network","Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve differential equations and give compressed, analytic solutions free of discretization. Previous work used PINNs to model shear wave propagation from a spherical Gaussian impulse in an incompressible, transversely isotropic (ITI) material. Here, we extend this method to model the more complex geometry of an acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and subsequent 3D shear wave propagation in both isotropic and ITI materials. We find that PINNs produce high-fidelity 3D solutions across different material models. PINN solutions qualitatively matched paired finite element method (FEM) simulations and without artifacts seen in FEM related to spatial discretization. The frequency content of PINN solutions differed slightly from the FEM, depending on the initial excitation geometry. PINNs have the potential to help rapidly explore material model parameter spaces. We also investigate the feasibility of solving the inverse problem to reconstruct material parameters from observed data by setting these parameters as variable outputs of the PINN model. PINNs were able to reconstruct the shear modulus using data measured in an isotropic elastic phantom to within 3 percent. Lastly, we show that PINNs can reconstruct all three independent parameters of an ITI material model from data.", 07 November 2023 ,2023 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),"Felix Q.
