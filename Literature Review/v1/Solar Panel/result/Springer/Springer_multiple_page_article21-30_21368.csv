Energy Efficient Intra Cluster Gateway Optimal Placement in Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-021-08247-z,12,article,Springer,"WSN,Clustering,Energy efficiency,Optimization,Intra-clustering,LEACH,PSO,GA,Mobile agents,Energy consumption,ICGW-PSOGA,ACO,Network lifetime","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is composed of self-organizing and tiny nodes that can process and transmit the data over wireless medium. The energy conservation and effective energy utilization is a significant problem to be considered in WSN. Many previous cluster based solutions relied on routing protocols, considered the relationship between sensor nodes and cluster head. It might lead to the probability of nodes that are left without being a member of any of the clusters called as residual nodes. These residual nodes might decrease the network's lifetime. The resource-constrained sensor nodes have been included in specific networks for exploring their surroundings and processing through one or multiple gateways to send the gathered data. Gateways in the network could be done in a controlled manner to communicate between sensors of WSN that can be utilized for several applications. For improving the lifetime of WSN, several sinks are deployed optimally which has been considered as one of the efficient energy techniques. This work presents the latest structure which would comprise the mechanism of effective clustering along with Intra Cluster Gateway (IC-GW). IC-GW depends on Particle Swarm Optimization with Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA) termed as ICGW-PSOGA for distance-communication and optimal SINK placement in WSNs. This Intra Gateway would gather the data from the heads of cluster and would be delivering to the SINK. The PSO-GA relied estimation of location algorithm has been initiated for finding the most excellent arrangement for the Gateway and SINK relied on the structure of the network. This algorithm has been extensively examined on several scenarios with the variation in the simulation duration; numerous sensor nodes and range of communication. The simulation results are promising and the obtained results are compared and validated with the earlier mechanisms.",18 February 2021,Wireless Personal Communications,"Y. M. Raghavendra,U. B.

Natural Disaster Monitoring with Wireless Sensor Networks: A Case Study of Data-intensive Applications upon Low-Cost Scalable Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11036-013-0456-9,147,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor network,Natural disaster monitoring,Scalable system,Data-intensive application,Geohazard","The wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has applied in monitoring natural disasters for more than one decade. Disasters can be closely monitored by augmenting a variety of sensors, and WSN has merits in (1) low cost, (2) quick response, and (3) salability and flexibility. Natural disaster monitoring with WSN is a well-known data intensive application for the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints. It manifests a typical paradigm of data-intensive application upon low-cost scalable system. In this study, we first assessed representative works in this area by classifying those in the domains of application of WSNs for disasters and optimization technologies significantly distinguishing these from general-purpose WSNs. We then described the design of an early warning system for geohazards in reservoir region, which relies on the WSN technology inspired by the existing work with focuses on issues of (1) supporting reliable data transmission, (2) handling huge data of heterogeneous sources and types, and (3) minimizing energy consumption. This study proposes a dynamic routing protocol, a method for network recovery, and a method for managing mobile nodes to enable real-time and reliable data transmission. The system incorporates data fusion and reconstruction approaches to bring together all data into a single view of the geohazard under monitoring. A distributed algorithm for joint optimal control of power and rate has been developed, which can improve utility of network (> 95 %) and to minimize the energy consumption (reduction by > 20 % in comparison with LEACH).

An Unequal Cluster-Radius Approach Based on Node Density in Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-018-5779-1,18,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Unequal clustering,Node density,Energy efficiency","Lifetime is a major challenge in wireless sensor networks which depends on the energy consumption of the nodes. Energy limitation in nodes leads to many researches to find out new solutions for this problem. Clustering is an efficient solution for this issue. In clustering, all nodes that are distributed in an application zone should be partitioned into some virtual sections that are called clusters. Each cluster must have one node for managing intra-cluster tasks that is called cluster-head (CH). CHs are used for transmitting collected data to the base-station (BS). The multi-hop is one way of transferring CHs data to the BS which increases the data traffic on CHs near the BS. The unequal clustering is one of the solutions for solving bottleneck CH problems. The difference between equal and unequal clustering is in the type of cluster-radius, which could be fixed or variable. In this paper, a distributed unequal cluster-radius approach is proposed based on node density for clustering in WSNs that has two main phases: CH-selection and Member-join. CH-selection phase is based on global and local search, and member-join phase is done according to an evaluation function. Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to an increase in the lifetime of WSNs in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",05 May 2018,Wireless Personal Communications,"Javad Hamidzadeh,Mohammad Hadi Ghomanjani","(Faculty of Computer Engineering and Information Technology,Sadjad University of Technology,Mashhad,Iran)",

In the existing work clustering based symbiotic organism search method is used to share the data with assured reliability and packet delivery ratio. However, this approach lacks performance due to the intruder, and it is resolved in the proposed method by introducing the novel method namely hybridized pareto-glowworm swarm optimization and authenticated data communication. In this paper, cluster head selection is made by considering multiple quality of service parameters such mobility and energy whereas in the previous research only energy is considered. To select the optimal cluster head with multiple objectives, a pareto optimal method is hybridized with the GSO algorithm for the multi-objective fitness evaluation. Here formation of clusters is purely based on the selected cluster Head. After clustering, data is gathered from the multiple sensor nodes which are aggregated to reduce the bandwidth utilization and forwarded to the base station. To ensure the security level in this work authentication between the cluster head and the base station is done and then data is transmitted.

An important problem in 3D WSN is the sensor energy optimization which determines a topology of sensors to prolong the network lifetime and energy expenditure. The existing methods for dealing with this matter namely low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, LEACH-centralized, K-Means, single hop clustering and energy efficient protocol, hybrid-LEACH and fuzzy C-means organize the networks into clusters where non-cluster head nodes mainly carry out sensing tasks and send the information to the cluster head, while cluster head collect data from other nodes and send to the base station (BS). Although these algorithms reduce the total energy consumption of the network, they also create a large number of network disconnect which refers to the number of sensors that cannot connect to its cluster head and the number of cluster heads that cannot connect to the BS.

Optimal Stable Cluster Head Selection Method for Maximal Throughput and Lifetime of Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-02459-9,1,article,Springer,"Cluster head,Network lifetime,First node die,Last node die,Unexpended energy","The previously reported works e.g., E-LEACH, and RCH-LEACH have proposed energy-efficient CH selection methods with coverage enhancement and varying numbers of overall CH nodes in a network. To further improve the performance, the stable CH selection method, i.e., SCH-LEACH is proposed with unexpended energy of nodes. The SCH-LEACH improves the overall lifetime of the network with minimal energy consumption. However, SCH-LEACH compromises the overall throughput of the network. The throughput analysis shows that the throughput of SCH-LEACH is lower than LEACH, E-LEACH, and RCH-LEACH.

The energy saving and effective utilization of energy are major issues in WSNs. The relationship between the cluster heads and sensor nodes was only considered in previous cluster-based routing protocols by ignoring the cost differences among them. The residual nodes, which are not considered as cluster members, may exist in certain existing clustering protocols. The network lifetime might be reduced by these residual nodes. Clustering is a proven technique for energy optimization. However, most of the clustering algorithms failed to address the routing overhead and the energy consumption rate between the CH nodes and the SINK node. Here, we introduce a new improved energy-efficient intra-cluster routing technique using mobile agents to reduce communication overhead and an optimal positioning strategy of SINK node using PSOGA for energy optimization. A novel framework is proposed in this method, in which an effective clustering mechanism using Intra Mobile Agents (IN-MA) is present. Moreover, on the basis of the network structure, an optimal position is determined for the sink by introducing a Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA)-based location estimation algorithm. The data are collected from the members and delivered to the CHs using Intra Mobile Agents. The PSO-GA algorithm estimates the optimal position of a sink. Based on the experimental results, the better outcomes are observed using the proposed method when compared to the previous techniques.

But, the hurdle faced by WSN is the limited resources of SNs. Hence, there is a high demand to design and implement an energy-efficient scheme to prolong the performance parameters of WSN. Clustering-based routing is the most suitable approach to support for load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliable communication to prolong performance parameters of WSN. These performance parameters are achieved at the cost of reduced lifetime of cluster head (CH).

Optimal election of cluster heads is an NP (non deterministic polynomial time)-Hard problem. In our proposed work, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II based clustering in wireless sensor networks has been proposed. Energy conservation, network lifetime, coverage and load balancing are the four conflicting objective functions used. Our proposed algorithm handles all of these multiple objectives simultaneously. To reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, efficient non-dominated level update mechanism for sorting has been used, which eliminates the need of applying non dominated sorting from scratch every time. The algorithm returns a solution set consisting of multiple non dominated solutions, wherein every solution is a best solution according to some objective function, in a single run, from which any solution can be chosen based on user preferences. According to our simulation carried on MATLAB, the proposed approach outperforms the established clustering algorithms in terms of network characteristics such as network lifetime, energy consumption and number of packets received.",06 March 2020,Wireless Networks," Gunjan,Karan Verma,Ajay K Sharma","(Computer Science and Engineering,National Institute of Technology,Delhi,India),(I.K.Gujral Punjab Technical University,Kapurthala,India)","India,India"

Data aggregation, Energy consumption, bandwidth utilization, and dynamic traffic routing play a significant role and impose challenges in achieving QoS in a sensor network. Therefore, it is crucial to concentrate on these factors in order to increase the network's lifetime and quality of service. The research's goal is to analyse IoT WSNs in terms of their architecture, framework, security, data aggregation, and routing techniques. In IoT WSNs, the data aggregation technique reduces the energy consumption of the network's nodes. This improves the network's energy and other QoS parameter's efficiency. The network layer hybrid data aggregation and routing protocol proposed in this study is new and efficient. In this work, a novel method for data aggregation based on anchor-based routing and matrix filling theory is proposed. It is suggested to use improved Anchor-based Routing protocol for Event Reporting (ARER), an anchor-based routing technique that includes dynamic clustering and constrained flooding.

A wireless device runs on batteries and uses a base station (BS) to send sensed data to the end user. WSNs are particularly prone to anomalies due to their complicated properties. Anomalies are abnormal data measurements obtained from sensors in a network for a range of factors, including faulty sensors or resource constraints such as computing capabilities, energy, or even faulty sensor communication systems. The main goal of the proposed algorithm is to develop an energy-efficient routing algorithm that can detect abnormalities in the environment and extend the network's stability period and lifespan. There have been three distinct anomaly detection methods used: random forest, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and local outlier factor (LOF). In the proposed work, the heterogeneous network has been classified into two regions based on sensor location and the node’s energy level to overcome load and power distribution issues. In the first region, the nodes participate in the clustering process, and for efficient cluster heads (CHs) selection, an objective function called Node Performance Score (NPS) has been introduced, whereas in the other region, relay nodes have been established for efficient data collection to enhance the network lifespan.

Hierarchical network architecture, based on clustering, can reduce energy consumption, balance traffic load, improve scalability, and prolong network lifetime. However, clustering faces two main challenges: hotspot problem and searching for effective techniques to perform clustering. This paper introduces a fuzzy unequal clustering technique for heterogeneous dense WSNs to determine both final cluster heads and their radii. Proposed fuzzy system blends three effective parameters together which are: the distance to the base station, the density of the cluster, and the deviation of the node’s residual energy from the average network energy. Our objectives are achieving gain for network lifetime, energy distribution, and energy consumption.

A single-objective function incorporating all information required to solve the problem appears appropriate, but not without the penalties of slow convergence and difficulty in obtaining the best fitness function. This paper therefore implements a hybrid evolutionary system that minimises these penalties. We conscript two distance fitness functions, to improve communication distance between sensor nodes and cluster heads (CHs), and between CHs and the sink or base station. These functions are then mainstreamed into a globally defined fitness function using genetic algorithm (GA). Important parameters established by the GA topology are then preserved to serve a variety of modified particle swarm optimisation (PSO) models, to discover how suitable they reshape the optimisation process. Simulation results revealed the robustness of our proposed hybrid framework, as the framework enabled consistent coverage clustering topology. The GA multi-objective fitness function could maintain good genetic diversity and genealogy across the population generations, as the clustered topology of the sensor network presented a stable structure such that mobile sensor nodes do not unnecessarily exceed the global boundary. The PSO-fitness function guaranteed that particles maintained the shortest possible distance within the (population) cluster space. Furthermore, the modified PSO with Time Varying Inertia Weight and Constriction factor (PSO-TVIW–C) achieved tremendous improvements in the overall performance and is effective in solving optimisation problems of distance minimisation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).",03 September 2019,International Journal of Wireless Information Networks,"Moses E.

As sensors are usually used in inaccessible areas, replacing or recharging the battery turns out to be almost impossible. It is actually, energy consumption which constitutes the major problem that causes too much trouble with these networks. In this respect, clustering algorithms prove to provide a remarkably adequate solution to cope with such a problem. This technique appears very helpful in minimizing the node energy consumption thus increasing the network’s lifespan. There exist two types of clustering algorithms: homogeneous and heterogeneous. In homogeneous clustering algorithms, all nodes have the same technical characteristics (bandwidth, processor, initial energy, etc.) while in heterogeneous clustering algorithms, nodes bear different technical characteristics, in other words, some of them holding greater capacity than others.

A cluster-tree-based energy-efficient routing protocol for wireless sensor networks with a mobile sink,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-020-03501-w,21,article,Springer,"Wireless sensor networks,Mobile sink,Energy efficiency,Network life cycle,Tree routing,Clustering","With the rapid development of the Internet of Things technology, wireless sensor networks as the core technique have been applied in military, precision agriculture, security monitoring, intelligent traffic, instrument monitoring and so on. In wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks, the sensor nodes have limited energy supply and the sink is removable. To improve the network efficiency and the sink utilization, we present a cluster tree-based energy-efficient routing protocol (CTEER). The protocol is based on rendezvous which is capable of reducing the latency. CTEER firstly plans the mobile path for the sink and creates a cross-communication region. Then, a cross-routing tree with the mobile sink as the center is constructed within the region. The routing tree changes with the location of the sink in each round so that the utilization rate of sensor nodes can be improved. Meanwhile, we divide the ordinary nodes outside the cross-region into multiple clusters. The ordinary nodes can send data to the routing tree directly through the cluster heads. In this way, transmission hops from ordinary nodes to the routing tree can be decreased. Thus, the data latency can be reduced. Experimental results show that CTEER protocol keeps competitive in terms of energy saving, network lifetime and data latency reduction. In four experimental environments, compared with RRP, the total energy consumption of nodes in each round in CTEER is decreased by 77.58%, 62.03%, 57.01% and 50.95%, respectively. In three experimental environments, compared with FRM, the total energy consumption of nodes in each round in CTEER is reduced by 35.04%, 29.93% and 4.08%, respectively. Compared with RRP, the total hops of sensor nodes in each round in CTEER are reduced by 82.44%, 75.56%, 74.16% and 78.04%, respectively. Compared with FRM, the hops are decreased by 43.25%, 40.19%, 39.10% and 39.64%, respectively. Considering the low delay advantage, CTTEER is suitable for time-sensitive applications.

However, in clustering, the cluster are formed with uneven size. This unbalances the energy consumption among clusters which in turn reduce the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in order to balance the energy among clusters, a multi-hop concept is introduced for both intra and inter cluster communication. Firstly, the RFDMRP: River Formation Dynamics based Multi-hop Routing Protocol has been proposed. Later, this protocol is integrated with clustering and a new hybrid technique, named as hybrid clustering communication algorithm using RFDMRP (HCCRFD) is introduced. HCCRFD improves energy conservation by reducing overall packet transmission distance of intra and inter cluster communication, which results in increased network lifetime.

Sensor nodes are cheap, small, and battery-powered devices with limited processing capabilities and memory. WSNs are mostly developed directly on the top of the operating system. They are tied to the hardware configuration of the sensor nodes, and their design and implementation can require cooperation with a myriad of system stakeholders with different backgrounds.

FSO is employed in many applications including Internet and mobile services links. Nevertheless, FSO link quality is affected by weather conditions including fog, rain, and snow. The main challenge of the FSO channel is the dynamic fluctuating of these weather conditions which degrade the link quality and reduces the data rate. Therefore, the development of robust FSO link topology is a crucial issue to overcome the bad and severe weather conditions. Cluster-based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) arranges the network into groups called clusters where one Cluster Head (CH) is selected to manage the communication activities inside the group. CHs localization is the main challenge in cluster-based WSN. The key objective of this research is to develop cluster-based WSN that employs the FSO links to interconnect the CHs to each other. Optimal Cluster Head Localization (OCHL) algorithm is developed to optimally determined the locations of CHs so that the network diversity and coverage area of CHs are improved. Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique is used to obtain a near-optimal solution for the proposed fitness function. Simulation results show that the proposed OCHL algorithm improves the network diversity and coverage area of cluster-based WSN. The weighting parameter of the proposed fitness function can be adjusted to control the effects of covered areas, and link diversity in the fitness function. Additionally, increasing the number of CHs leads to improve the covered area and link diversity. Furthermore, with growing of the number of GA iterations, a better solution for the proposed optimization problem is obtained. Moreover, the Bit Error Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio of FSO links are evaluated based on the rain rate, snow rate, fog, transmitted power, transmitter and receiver aperture diameters, FSO communication range, and weighting parameter. The results demonstrate that the normalized covered area in case of using the proposed OCHL algorithm outperforms as compared to NFCA and LEACH algorithms with 12.95 and 8.52% rise, respectively. In addition, the proposed OCHL algorithm enhances the normalized link diversity by 14.15 and 19.21%, compared with NFCA and LEACH algorithms, respectively.",28 August 2024,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,Yousef E.

Sensor nodes sense, monitor, record, receive and transmit any kind of data based on its manufacturing motivation. Sensors are cheap in cost, small in size and restricted in energy efficiency. Owing to their remote deployment and small size, they are provided with limited battery power. When the energy drains out, it becomes dead and thus causes a bottleneck in the communication process. Subsequent failure of nodes due to inefficient routing methods tends to degrade the network lifetime and overall performance. Several earlier research methods were used for improving the network lifetime and reliability of node’s connection and communication. Most of the methods were not able to provide optimal performance towards enhancing overall QoS which happens to be a collective attribute.

The optimization of nodes clustering and multi-hop routing protocol using hierarchical chimp optimization for sustainable energy efficient underwater wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-023-03464-9,11,article,Springer,"Nodes clustering,Multi-hop routing,Chimp optimization algorithm,Hierarchical","The design of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) faces many challenges, including power consumption, storage, battery life, and transmission bandwidth. UWSNs usually either use node clustering or multi-hop routing as their energy-efficient optimization algorithms. The cluster optimization technique will organize the sensor nodes into a cluster network, with each cluster led by a cluster head (CH). In contrast, the multi-hop optimization algorithm will create a multi-hop network by sending data to the base station (BS) while switching between different sensor nodes. However, the overburdens of CH nodes impact the performance of the cluster optimization method, whereas the overburdens of nodes close to the BS impact the performance of the multi-hop optimization algorithm. Therefore, clustering and routing procedures can be considered as a simultaneous NP-hard problem that metaheuristic algorithms can address. With this motivation, this paper proposes an energy-efficient clustering and multi-hop routing protocol using the metaheuristic-based algorithm to increase energy efficiency in UWSNs and lengthen the network life. However, the existing metaheuristic-based methods use two separate algorithms for clustering and multi-hop routing, increasing computational complexity, different initialization, and difficulty in hyperparameters’ tuning. In order to address the mentioned shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical structure called hierarchical chimp optimization (HChOA) for both clustering and multi-hop routing processes. The proposed HChOA is validated using various metrics after being simulated using an extended set of experiments. Results are compared to those from LEACH, TEEN, MPSO, PSO, and IPSO-GWO to validate the impact of the HChOA.

Sending data collected through nodes in the WSN results in more energy drain. Repeating this procedure drains the primary energy of nodes. So, the network lifetime is expired. This research proposes an algorithm called NEECH based on three dimensions of energy, distance, and density of nodes. The NEECH algorithm improves the network lifetime. Our algorithm is based on the gravity center and the mass center to select the probable cluster head and is selected the best cluster head by genetic algorithm.

Therefore, our primary goal is to extend the lifespan of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). As a result, we propose a novel energy-efficient routing protocol—addresses the most important issue for WSNs (i.e., network lifetime). The proposed iterative parent based routing algorithm (IPRA), commences with the cluster heads (CHs) selection, based on the maximum residual energy and considering the appropriate distance between any two CHs. Later, each CH creates some predefined specific levels in its cluster based on the distance between itself and its cluster members. Based on the levels formed, each node initiates the selection of parents by considering the closest node in the preceding level. Hence, recursively, every node transmits its sensed data to its parent, and finally, the data sensed by all the cluster members are aggregated at the CH, which in turn transmits it to the sink.

The proposed protocol is labeled (ASTEEN) referring to an adaptive soft-thresholding-based energy-efficient sensor network. Its objective is to allow less energy consumption for data transition that affects the lifetime of the network. So, the node lifetime increases, and also the network lifetime increases. In contrary to other fixed soft-thresholding-based protocols, the adaptive soft threshold dynamically gets lower as the significance of the value of the sensed physical parameter increases. This leads to less-frequent transmission of less-critical sensed values, and more frequent transmission of more critical sensed values.

Node utilization index-based data routing and aggregation protocol for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05800-4,1,article,Springer,"Aggregation Factor,Bandwidth,Data Aggregation,Energy Efficiency,Network Lifetime,Routing,Utilization Index","Data aggregation using the shortest path is a challenging issue in wireless sensor networks. Data aggregation slows the communication process and consumes many resources available to sensor nodes. So, while transmitting the aggregated data, it is crucial to identify the shortest and most reliable route for energy-efficient data aggregation from the source to the sink node. However, the nodes closer to the sink node are heavily utilized in multi-hop transmission and succumb to early death, which causes energy imbalance and an energy hole problem in the network. To overcome this problem, we propose an innovative node utilization index-based data routing and aggregation (NUIDRA) protocol. The NUIDRA protocol is designed and implemented in two phases. The first phase is to determine the shortest path from the source node to the sink node based on the amount of bandwidth utilized by each sensor node, minimum hop count, node’s residual energy, and data aggregation factor. In the second phase, the selected shortest path is used for data transmission and aggregation using the dynamic selection of the aggregator node. The choice of aggregator node is based on the node’s utilization index (UI) and adjacent node count from which it receives the data. The NUIDRA protocol is compared and analysed with I-LEACH and QADA protocols. The extensive simulation results show that in the proposed NUIDRA protocol, there is an increase in the average throughput of 70%, packet delivery ratio by 41.93%, and the average latency is reduced by 58.15% as compared to the I-LEACH protocol. Further, there is an increase in the average throughput of 24%, packet delivery ratio by 7.31%, and the average latency is reduced by 53.23% as compared to the QADA protocol for a data packet size of 512 bytes.",06 December 2023,The Journal of Supercomputing,"Archana Bomnale,Avinash More","(Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering,MPSTME,NMIMS University,Mumbai,400056,India)",India

These sensors self-organize and establish multi-hop connections for communication, collectively sensing, gathering, processing, and transmitting data about their surroundings. Despite their significance, WSNs face rapid and detrimental attacks that can disrupt functionality. Existing intrusion detection methods for WSNs encounter challenges such as low detection rates, computational overhead, and false alarms. These issues stem from sensor node resource constraints, data redundancy, and high correlation within the network. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative intrusion detection approach that integrates machine learning (ML) techniques with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique Tomek Link (SMOTE-TomekLink) algorithm. This blend synthesizes minority instances and eliminates Tomek links, resulting in a balanced dataset that significantly enhances detection accuracy in WSNs. Additionally, we incorporate feature scaling through standardization to render input features consistent and scalable, facilitating more precise training and detection. To counteract imbalanced WSN datasets, we employ the SMOTE-Tomek resampling technique, mitigating overfitting and underfitting issues.

These SNs are powered by a battery which is a significant constraint due to its limited capacity(battery) in ad-hoc IoT networks. Since these SNs are deployed in large numbers forming a network, the network’s lifetime is required to be prolonged to serve the objective of deploying the SNs. If the SNs exhaust their energy at par, then the network’s lifetime can easily be extended. For achieving an almost equal energy dissipation rate of SNs, the load among the SNs should be balanced. This paper has propounded a load-balanced, efficient clustering and routing (LBECR) protocol for sustainable IoT in smart cities to muddle through this issue. Since in Adhoc IoT networks, the nodes are resource-constrained, with the escalation of input variables in the fuzzy system, the number of rules increases exponentially, leading to more energy dissipation. Therefore we have designed three Fuzzy Inference Systems with minimal inputs for cluster head (CH) selection, formation of clusters and routing of data. The cost to the CH node is considered as one of the parameters of the Fuzzy system as it has a significant impact on the stability period. A fuzzy system is designed for efficient multi-hop routing, conserving a significant amount of network energy.

WSN nodes often operate on limited battery capacity, so energy efficiency is a significant problem for clustering and routing. In addition to these limitations, one of the primary issues of WSNs is achieving reliability and security of transmitted data in vulnerable environments to prevent malicious node attacks. This work aims to develop a secure and energy-efficient routing protocol for fault data prediction to enhance WSNs network lifespan and data reliability. The proposed technique has three major phases: cluster construction, optimal route selection, and intrusion detection. The adaptive shark smell optimization (ASSO) technique was initially used with three input parameters for CH selection. These parameters are the residual energy, the distance to the BS, and the node density. After clustering, salp swarm optimization (SSO) is used to select the optimum path for data transmission between clusters, resulting in an energy-efficient WSN. Finally, to ensure the security of cluster-based WSNs, an effective intrusion detection system based on a modified Elman recurrent neural network (MERNN) is implemented to detect the presence of intrusions in the network. The experimental results show that it outperforms the competing methods in various performance metrics. The performance results of quality of service (QoS) parameters are expressed as dispersion value (0.8072), packet delivery rate (98%), average delay (160 ms), network lifetime (3200 rounds), and the accuracy of this method is 99.2%.

If any two close sensor nodes are seldom in the active-state the assignment of shared keys may be gratuitous, since they may be hardly exploited.In this paper, based on this information, secure and Energy-Efficient Traffic Aware key Management (EETKM) is developed for WSN. This determines shared keys for active sensors which takes part in the direct communication. In order to broadcast keys without retransmission or acknowledgements, the proposed scheme gives an efficient Re-keying mechanism. The proposed scheme attains high connectivity which is shown through numerical results. The proposed scheme is applied for various routing protocols and the simulation results shows the stronger resilience, low energy consumption and increased delivery ratio.",27 November 2011,International Journal of Wireless Information Networks,"C.

Energy efficient clustering algorithms for wireless sensor networks: novel chemical reaction optimization approach,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-015-1156-0,53,article,Springer,"Clustering,NP-hard,Chemical reaction optimization,Wireless sensor networks","Clustering has been accepted as one of the most efficient techniques for conserving energy of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, in a two-tiered cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving data from their member sensor nodes, aggregating them and transmitting that data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper selection of CHs and optimal formation of clusters play a crucial role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient CH selection and energy balanced cluster formation algorithms, which are based on novel chemical reaction optimization technique (nCRO), we jointly called these algorithms as novel CRO based energy efficient clustering algorithms (nCRO-ECA). These algorithms are developed with efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and potential energy functions. For the energy efficiency, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes in the CH selection phase. In the cluster formation phase, we consider various distance and energy parameters. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs by varying number of sensor nodes and CHs. The results are compared with original CRO based algorithm, namely CRO-ECA and some existing algorithms to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption, network lifetime, packets received by the BS and convergence rate.",26 December 2015,Wireless Networks,"P.

The IoT-based applications need to be optimized regarding the changing requirements of users as everything is connected via the internet. In today’s era, where every day new technologies were rebuilt where sensor nodes plays an important role on it. In every field, whether it is healthcare, smart agriculture, smart home appliances, smart traffic, or smart city sensors were deployed for sensing their environment, collecting data from them, and forwarding it to the servers. These sensor nodes were made up of non-rechargeable power batteries, as a fact efficient energy consumption of these batteries becomes vital. In WSN, efficient energy consumption is still an issue, and its solutions were given by many researchers among them, clustering is considered to be more effective in this domain. For efficient energy consumption, multi-attributes of cluster head selection need to be considered and proper coordination among the conflicting nature of multi-attributes needs to be done. In this paper, we have proposed PROMETHEE II and modified AHP together for cluster heads selection by considering multi-attributes. Twenty-one attributes were considered including connectivity, distance to the base station, residual energy, member nodes, and many more. Being conflicting in nature, proper coordination among these attributes has been done and optimal cluster heads were selected modified for data transmissions. In this paper, modified AHP has been compared with our proposed modified PROMETHEE II and AHP for understanding the significance of this integration.

Recently, several hybrid, dynamic and static clustering protocols have been proposed to solve this challenge. In this paper, a hybrid unequal energy efficient clustering is proposed to improve previous methods and increase lifetime of the network. In the proposed protocol, a new mechanism called clustering strategy is used. This mechanism, based on arrangement of nodes in a network, determines whether nodes should use information of their neighbors or should not use this information. This strategy helps to reduce overhead considerably. On the other hand, clustering is unequal so that nodes closer to base station (BS) have more energy to receive and relay data towards BS. In order to reduce overhead, clustering is designed as hybrid static–dynamic so that transmitting control message for clustering is not required at each round. Two new techniques are proposed for routing. First, assistance to cluster heads mechanism which allows cluster heads to get help from some of its member nodes which have suitable energy and distance to help sharing cluster’s load. In other words, a new intra-cluster multi-hop routing is proposed. Second new technique is discretion license which is performed in real time and allows the nodes to prevent transmissions of packets that may arrive at a destination in an incomplete form.

Here the greater the distance between the nodes, higher the energy consumption. For having the effective transmission of data with less energy, the cluster-head approach is used. It is well known that the time delay is directly proportional to the distance between the nodes and the base station. The cluster head is selected in such a way that it is spatially closer enough to the base station as well as the sensor nodes. So, the time delay can be substantially reduced. This, in turn, the transmission speed of the data packets can be increased.

A proposed efficient node stable routing () protocol is introduced to guarantee the stability of transmission data between the source and destination nodes, in a dynamic WSN conditions.  minimizes energy consumption and selects more stable nodes for packets forwarding. Stability becomes the most important factor that qualifies the node's centrality. A node’s stability is characterized by residual energy, link quality, and number of hops needed to reach the destination from the node. To calculate node's stability, an enhanced centrality concept, known as stable betweenness centrality () is introduced. In , at first, some nodes will be selected as the stable forwarding nodes, usually with maximum  between their neighbors within a limited communication radio range of a particular region. Furthermore, each stable forwarding node then broadcasts its identity, including , to the source node separately. The source node can compute a stable path to forward packets to the corresponding stable forwarding node, based on a proper designed stable path routing metric (). Then, the stable forwarding node will behave as a new source node and start another stable path routing process until the packets are forwarded and reached to the destination node. In addition, the change of stable nodes over time balances and conserves node energy consumption, thereby mitigating “hot spots”. The proposed routing protocol is validated through simulation.

Hence, the network consumes more energy which is the main and challenging issue in WSNs. Since the sensor is operating under battery, recharging is impossible and hence the lifetime of each sensor is an important issue. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new and efficient techniques to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, a new delay constrained energy efficient routing technique is proposed for performing effective routing in WSNs. This approach introduces a delay constraint based reliable routing approach which reduces the energy consumption by constructing efficient clusters without increasing the end-to-end delay. Moreover, the proposed technique called the rule based clustering for routing model provides better performance in terms of network lifetime than the other existing techniques since they consume more energy during the formation of clusters and finding the shortest path. Moreover, additional overhead on the cluster head selection is tackled also using rules in this proposed model in an efficient manner by building balanced clusters. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it extends the lifetime of the network and increases the throughput, energy efficiency, link quality and scalability.

Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important part of IoT, and it is mainly responsible for acquiring and reporting data. As lifetime and coverage area of WSN directly determine IoT performance, how to design a method to conserve nodes energy and reduce nodes death rates become important issues. Sensor network clustering is one efficient method to solve these problems. It divides nodes into clusters and selects one to be cluster head (CH). The data transmission and communication within one cluster are managed by its CH. Many traditional strategies have been designed out, but because of network dynamic feature, machine learning methods become more attractive and many literature are working on them. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one evolutionary algorithm. Inspired by this algorithm, we propose a novel energy-aware bio-inspired clustering scheme (PSO-WZ). We firstly initialize CHs combination randomly and assign non-CHs based on division rules. Then, using the fitness function to guide the selection process until the maximum time is reached. Since the division rule is directly related with the network topology and node energy consumption distribution, we design it from two angles: non-CHs and the whole network, to save the energy of each node as much as possible. Meanwhile, in order to balance energy load among nodes, which contributes to lowering nodes reduction and preserving network coverage range, we introduce the Gini coefficient into the objective function.

Large volume of data processing challenges the long survival of the WSN. In other way, expecting accurate tracking result with less data is quite impossible. Early exhaustion of node energy leads to early node death which affects the tracking quality. Therefore, it is required to maintain the accuracy in tracking result while not affecting the longevity of the network.

Considering the battery-limited property of sensor nodes, recently, energy harvesting (EH) technology is introduced into WSN, which can alleviate traditional WSN problems (energy consumption, energy equilibrium, transmission efficiency, etc.). Current EH-WSN routing algorithms generally use the continuous energy harvesting mode, therefore, how to design an efficient routing algorithm for discrete energy harvesting mode and ensure the overall energy balance and conservation is still a great challenge and needs to be solved. Especially, under the mobile environment, the impact of route stability needs to be considered, which makes the design more complicated. To address the above problems, we propose a learning automata (LA) theory based stable and energy-efficient routing algorithm for discrete EH-mobile WSN (DEH-LA-SERA, for short). Firstly, we construct a multi-factors measurement model for sensor nodes, which contains node stability model, energy ratio function, expected harvesting energy model (using Markov decision process method) and direction judgement model. On this basis, we derive the node weighted value, i.e., selecting probability, which can be used to determine whether a node can be chosen as relay node. Secondly, with the help of LA theory, we construct a feedback mechanism to adjust the optimal path. With this solution, we can ensure the overall energy balance and conservation while holding the stability of selected path.

Multi-level clustering protocol for load-balanced and scalable clustering in large-scale wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-018-2727-5,11,article,Springer,"Cluster head selection,Dragonfly algorithm,Hierarchical clustering,Particle swarm optimization,Wireless sensor networks","The advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has revolutionized the field of smart applications. In order to improve the performance of WSNs, refinement of clustering and routing protocols can make a vast difference. Existing classical and evolutionary optimization technique-based protocols have high computational complexity since clustering and routing problems are solved separately. Moreover, these protocols suffer from hot-spot problem due to uneven formation of clusters. In this paper, we propose a multi-level clustering protocol (MLCP) for energy-efficient data gathering in large-scale WSNs. Additionally, a hierarchical clustering architecture is designed in MLCP to jointly solve the problems of clustering and routing. Further, for the purpose of cluster head selection, a hybrid dragonfly algorithm-based particle swarm optimization technique is proposed which combines the exploration and exploitation capabilities of dragonfly algorithm and particle swarm optimization, respectively. MLCP considers intra-cluster distance, node degree and inter-cluster distance for the formation of scalable, load-balanced and energy-efficient clusters. To demonstrate the full potential of MLCP, network simulations have been carried out in diverse network conditions. MLCP has shown up to 90% increase in the network lifetime and an improvement of 19.36% in conservation of energy in comparison with the competent protocols. The comparison of obtained results with state-of-the-art clustering protocols clearly establishes the superiority of MLCP in achieving load-balanced, scalable and energy-efficient clustering.

In certain cases F-MCHEL results in several small sized clusters increasing the inter cluster communication cost. This is due to the negligence of node degree in cluster head selection. The performance of F-SCH is observed to be better than F-MCHEL because super cluster head selection is based on centrality and mobility. Though it minimized inter cluster energy, the randomness in LEACH based cluster head selection inhibits the benefits of multilevel routing. Hence, with an objective to minimize the total energy consumed by the network, fuzzy based two-level hierarchical protocol is proposed. The objective is achieved by appropriate selection of cluster head and super cluster head. Cluster head selection is based on battery power, centrality and node degree while super cluster head selection is based on battery power, centrality and mobility of cluster heads.

The best known solution found by the current state-of-the-art approaches for the energy hole problem is the Mobile Sink (MS) strategy. However, allowing the MS to visit every node for data collection incurs high data delivery latency, which may not be feasible in delay-sensitive applications. Thus, in this paper, restricted mobile sink motion is considered, where the MS halts at a limited number of locations stated as sojourn locations and all nodes disseminate their data to the nearby sojourn locations. The data dissemination to the sojourn location is achieved via a cluster-based routing protocol which aims to preserve the sensor nodes’ energy to enhance the network lifetime. Furthermore, analogous to network lifetime, extending the coverage lifetime is of equal importance in many coverage sensitive applications of WSN. Thus, this article incorporates the coverage parameter to the proposed protocol in order to preserve the network coverage despite certain nodes die. Based on the sojourn locations, the proposed routing algorithm ensures that each cluster data is disseminated to the MS following the minimum hop path to limit the data delivery delay.

MNDREL is a novel algorithm, which is aimed at identifying malicious nodes in the wireless sensor network (WSN) more efficiently. Cluster-head nodes are first selected based on the enhanced LEACH routing protocol. Other nodes in WSN then form different clusters by selecting corresponding cluster-head nodes and determine the packets delivery paths. Each node then adds its node number and reputation evaluation value to the packet before sending it to the sink node. A list of suspicious nodes is then formed by comparing the node numbers, obtained through parsing with the packets by the sink node, with the source node numbers. To determine the malicious nodes in the network, the ratio of the suspect value to the trusted value of each node is further calculated and compared with a predefined threshold.

WSNs face various constraints, encompassing challenges related to communication, clustering management and the finite battery life of nodes. Thus, Energy conservation in such networks is indispensable. Given a constant energy consumption rate during information sensing and reception, the highest energy consumption among sensor nodes occurs during data transmission. One of promising solution to reduce energy consumption is organizing WSN in clusters. Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) involves grouping sensor nodes into clusters to facilitate efficient data aggregation, communication, and management within the network. This organizational structure helps optimize energy consumption, enhance scalability, and prolong the overall lifespan of the WSN. However determining the optimal criteria for selecting cluster heads is challenging, as it involves balancing energy efficiency, network connectivity, and load distribution.

Information gathering is a typical but an important operation in many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is necessary to operate the sensor network for longer period of time in an energy efficient manner for gathering information. One of the popular WSN protocol, named low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its variants, aim to prolong the network lifetime using energy efficient clustering approach. These protocols increase the network lifetime at the expense of reduced stability period (the time span before the first node dies). The reduction in stability period is because of the high energy variance of nodes. Stability period is an essential aspect to preserve coverage properties of the network. Higher is the stability period, more reliable is the network. Higher energy variance of nodes leads to load unbalancing among nodes and therefore lowers the stability period.

Therefore, the energy is limited. This paper aims to improve the energy efficiency of sensor nodes in order to extend the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose four new hierarchical clustering topology architectures: random cluster head and sub-cluster head (RCHSCH), random cluster head and max energy sub-cluster head (RCHMESCH), random cluster head and sub-cluster head with sleep mode (RCHSCHSM) and random cluster head and max energy sub-cluster head with sleep mode (RCHMESCHSM).

Notably, RCHSCH can improve upon cluster head death within the LEACH architecture. In addition, we develop a sleep mode for sensor nodes based on correlations among sensor data within sub-clusters in RCHSCHSM. Thus, we can reduce the energy consumption of the sensor node and increase energy efficiency.

Whereas, hierarchical routing based protocols in WSNs are beneficial in agricultural monitoring as the network transmission load towards the sink is reduced. It decreases the energy requirement for routing the data. Following this, a deep Q-network (DQN) based energy aware multi-path routing of data towards the sink node in the WSNs is proposed in this paper. It improves the energy efficiency of sensor nodes, which in turn can eventually increase the network lifetime. Employing the proposed energy efficient routing technique, effective monitoring of the soil-moisture data in an agricultural field is taken into account. Initially, the soil moisture data from different depths of an agricultural field is collected, and it is then forwarded to an aggregator node. The principle component analysis is used for the data aggregation to obtain accurate correlated data with low power requirements. Finally, the aggregated data is routed from the aggregator node to the network gateway via the sink nodes in an energy efficient manner. The proposed DQN based routing uses the Q-table to store the Q-values for different state-action pairs.

Data exchange is a significant and often performed operation in any WSN which has to be operated with less energy consumption. Bio-inspired clustering protocols are proving a success in minimizing energy consumption and are of current research interest by many researchers. This paper briefs on work carried on the classification of mushroom into edible or non-edible. Since most mushrooms are dangerous to health and may lead to death, henceforth is it is essential to identify the edibility of mushroom. Mushroom features identified by sensor such as ring, odur, spore_print_color, stalk_color_above, stalk_surface_above, and gill size are forwarded to base station (BS). Ant Lion optimization clustering algorithm (ALOC) is adopted in the routing of information to BS. ALOC avoids improper clustering reducing multiple messages at BS. The work is divided into two phases in the initial phase sensing of mushroom features and forwarding to BS is performed through WSN. In the second phase, the decision is taken whether mushroom is edible or not applying class-based association rules (CBA).

In this article authors have proposed a Multihop harmony search algorithm for WSN with two objectives, first being increasing the throughput of the network and second being optimizing the energy consumption of the sensor nodes and thereby prolonging the lifetime of network. Finding the goodness of the communication channel/path is quite important. Sometimes, though the channel capacity is more, fewer amounts of data may be transmitted in the channel resulting in under utilization of the resources; and other times, though the channel capacity is less, more data may be dumped into the channel resulting in channel congestion and less output. Thus, if the goodness of the communication channel is known in advance, then it is easy for the algorithms to decide the upper bound of the channel and can have a congestion free and error free information transmission. Thus, the proposed algorithm employ Shannon channel capacity ‘C’ (baud rate) for finding the best next hop and the same is used for initialization of Harmony Memory. An effective local search strategy is also proposed to strengthen the local harmony search ability so that the convergence speed and the accuracy of routing algorithm is improved. Finally, an objective function model is developed by taking path length, energy consumption, and residual energy in to consideration. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing Multihop LEACH, BRM (Baud rate based Multihop routing protocol) and EEHSBR (Energy Efficient Harmony Search Based Routing) algorithm for the quantitative and qualitative analysis.

The proposed method called Queen honey bee migration (QHBM) algorithm mimics the migration process of queen honey bee in nature. In short, the queen begins her journey to find the new location for hive which assisted by scout bees. Queen may visit several places until she found the place to settle down. Henceforth, sink represents Queen and CH nodes are assigned as scout bees. In QHBM, sink relocates itself from the initial position towards the selected pole of cardinal direction, for example: sink moves towards North pole. The sink movement is guided by CH nodes which have highest remaining energy. After arrived in the new position, sink recalculates parameters for next journey. Sink collects data whenever it arrived in the future position. CH nodes are rotated in each journey of a sink. Therefore, the proposed method can balance the energy consumption among nodes and prolong network lifetime. We conducted simulation and compared the proposed QHBM algorithm with static sink and existing sink repositioning schemes, namely random, rendezvous, and EASR. We clearly found that the network lifetime with all sink repositioning schemes is longer than static sink.

WSN is a vast number of geographically scattered devices that use sensor nodes to communicate and gather information from the target region. In clustered WSNs, the cluster head (CH) is deliberated as the relay node at a higher energy level than the non-CH nodes. The relay nodes perform more tasks related to the non-CHs, and these relay nodes are restricted by energy and communication capacity. Therefore, balancing the load of the relay node is a significant concern for improving the performance of the WSNs. Clustering is a well-known technique enforced to balance the load of the relay nodes. Often, densely loaded relay nodes dissolve their energy in less time and may cause changes in the topology of the network. In this study, we propose a Quasi-oppositional based Jaya load balancing strategy (QOJ-LBS) with a novel fitness function to address the issue of load balancing. The novel fitness function derived from the convex combination of the least lifespan of the relay node across the network and the entropy value of the lifespan of all relay nodes. The proposed QOJ-LBS justifies the network performance under two different WSN conditions called scenario-1 and scenario-2 with single-hop and multi-hop routing.

The primary issue is to strengthen the lifespan of the network, as the node devices have bounded lifecycles owing to notable power constraints. Thus, to sustain the lifespan of WSNs, it is crucial to reinforce the energy administration at the node devices, as they are routinely deployed in secluded areas. Several energy management strategies have recently been used in this context. Among these alternatives, cluster-chain hybrid networks have demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce the node energy usage. However, the chain formation techniques often result in increased latency in large-scale scenarios. Similarly, it has been proven that coding techniques preserves the network reliability and energy efficiency.

In Adaptive Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Network (APTEEN), the assignments of the cluster head (CH) are much heavier than other nodes. The CH unbalanced energy dissipation between nodes that make them die prematurely. Ant colony algorithm can avoid this problem, so this paper presents a double cluster heads Adaptive Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Network based on ant colony (ADCAPTEEN). ADCAPTEEN optimizes the cluster head election method compared with APTEEN. It suggests that one master cluster head (MCH) and one vice cluster head (VCH) will be selected in each cluster. The double cluster heads (DCH) can co-work on data collection, fusion, transition, etc. To make routes more stable and energy efficient, this paper proposes a Multiple Adaptive Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Network based on Ant-colony (AMAPTEEN). It is the optimization of ADCAPTEEN. And CH selects intermediate node (IM_node) multiple times with ant colony algorithm per round in each cluster, and this way forms multiple route transmission data. Simulation in OPNET proves that compared with APTEEN, ADCAPTEEN reduces energy dissipation, improves node survival rate, and extends network life cycle. AMAPTEEN delays the time of node death, balances energy consumption, and extends network lifetime further operating in the same settings compared with ADCAPTEEN.

Recently, in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), clustering-based energy-aware routing protocols divide neighboring nodes into separate clusters and select local cluster heads so as to combine and transmit information of each of the clusters to the central station. In this way, they attempt to maintain energy consumption balance by the network nodes. When compared with other methods, clustering methods have been able to achieve the best efficiency with regard to the enhancement of network lifetime. In this paper, using cuckoo optimization algorithm, an energy-aware clustering-based routing protocol was proposed in WSNs which is able to cluster the network and select optimal cluster heads. The proposed method considered four criteria with regard to selecting cluster heads in the targeted cuckoo algorithm, namely the remaining energy of nodes, distance to the base station, within-cluster distances and between cluster distances. The results of simulating the proposed method in Matlab environment indicated it is better than other algorithms such as low energy adaptive clustering hierarchical (LEACH), application-specific low power routing, LACH-EP and LEACH with distance-based threshold with regard to the first node die on average and packet delivery rate for six scenario.",06 October 2017,Wireless Personal Communications,"Melika Khabiri,Ali Ghaffari","(Department of Computer Engineering,Germi Branch,Islamic Azad University,Germi,Iran),(Department of Computer Engineering,Tabriz Branch,Islamic Azad University,Tabriz,Iran)",

The sensor networks are powered by battery and thus they turn out to be dead after a particular interval. Hence, enhancing the data dissipation in energy efficient manner remains to be more challenging for increasing the life span of sensor devices. It has been already proved that the clustering method could improve or enhance the life span of WSNs. In the clustering model, the selection of cluster head (CH) in each cluster regards as the capable method for energy efficient routing, which minimizes the transmission delay in WSN. However, the main problem dealt with the selection of optimal CH that makes the network service prompt. Till now, more research works have been processing on solving this issue by considering different constraints. Under this scenario, this paper attempts to develop a new clustering model with optimal cluster head selection by considering four major criteria like energy, delay, distance, and security. Further, for selecting the optimal CHs, this paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm that hybridizes the concept of dragon fly and firefly algorithm algorithms, termed fire fly replaced position update in dragonfly.

Moth Flame Optimization Based Energy Efficient Stable Clustered Routing Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-018-6043-4,68,article,Springer,"MFO,WSN,Network lifetime,Stability period","The widespread use of wireless sensor devices and their advancements in terms of size, deployment cost and user friendly interface have given rise to many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs need to utilize routing protocols to forward data samples from event regions to sink via minimum cost links. Clustering is an efficient data aggregation method that effectively reduces the energy consumption by organizing nodes into groups. However, in clustering protocols, CH has to bear an additional load for coordinating various activities within the cluster. Therefore, proper CH selection and their load balancing using efficient routing protocol is a critical aspect for the long run operation of WSN. Clustering a network with proper load balancing is an NP-hard problem. To solve such problems having vast search area, optimization algorithm is the preeminent possible solution. In this paper, moth flame optimization (MFO) based threshold-sensitive energy-efficient clustering protocol (TECP) is proposed to extend the stability period of the network. Multi-hop communication between CHs and BS is utilized using MFO to achieve optimal link cost for load balancing of distant CHs and energy minimization.

So the current research proposed a novel African Buffalo based Two Tier Data Dissemination (AB-TTDD) strategy to monitor the energy drained node in an earlier stage before the data transmission. The fitness function of African Buffalo model is utilized to recognize the harmful and energy drained nodes in an earlier stage. Furthermore, a novel Temporary Energy Mapping Algorithm (TEMA) is developed to maintain the route by creating the reference node instead of energy drained node. This novel proposed mechanism has reduced the packet flow ratio and power consumption in a high manner.

For an ad hoc wireless network to work, it needs to have enough processing power, storage space, and battery life. Because they are open, don’t have security, have weak infrastructure, can be set up quickly, and are near potential conflict zones, they can be attacked in many ways. In the past few years, there have been more attacks on networks, which has led to a drop in many things, such as uptime, throughput, latency, energy use, and packet loss. Standard security measures, like intrusion detection systems, are not enough to ensure the networks are completely safe. Throughout this work, we’ll talk about a Proposed Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) system that uses two-tire techniques to make it easier to find and stop intrusions. The Proposed RBMs system that has been proposed is better than the methods that are currently being used in several ways. To reach this goal, a chaotic ant optimization-based algorithm is used (CAO).

A lot of existing technique that solved this issue with maintaining the network status and relevant information, but these techniques do not provide the proper validation and verification and completely depend upon the simulation. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of WSN, management of such environment is highly complex. The dynamic self-configuring behavior of the nodes and scalable nature of WSN may cause critical issues, like hotspot, power consumption, unnecessary delays, throughput and network lifetime. This paper, therefore, presents the Subnet Based Hotspot Algorithm (SBHA) that not only discus the strategy of network division in the form of subnets but also provide the detail verification proof of correctness. By doing so, routing path towards sink nodes become small in size that reduces the traffic load at the neighboring nodes of the sink. As a result, nodes around the sink will not early depreciate hence the chances of hotspot occurrence will be reduced, ultimately network lifetime will be increased.

This protocol considers two parameters for deciding the cluster heads, i.e., residual energy and node density and has been designed for the homogeneous WSNs. In this paper, we consider the implementation of HEED for a heterogeneous network. Depending upon the type of nodes, it defines one-level, two-level, and three-level heterogeneity and accordingly the implementation of HEED is referred to as hetHEED-1, hetHEED-2, and hetHEED-3, respectively. We also consider one more parameter, i.e., distance and apply fuzzy logic to determine the cluster heads and accordingly the hetHEED-1, hetHEED-2, and hetHEED-3 are named as HEED-FL, hetHEED-FL-2, hetHEED-FL-3, respectively. The simulation results show that as the level of heterogeneity increases in the network, the nodes remain alive for longer time and the rate of energy dissipation decreases. And also, increasing the heterogeneity level helps sending more packets to the base station and increases the network lifetime. The increase in the network energy increases the network lifetime manifold. In fact, using fuzzy logic, the network lifetime increases by 114.85 % that of the original HEED without any increase in the network energy. Thus, the hetHEED-FL-3 provides the longest lifetime (387.94 % increase) in lifetime at the cost of 19 % increase in network energy), sends maximum number of packets to the base station, and has minimum rate of energy dissipation.",06 February 2014,Wireless Personal Communications,"Satish Chand,Samayveer Singh,Bijendra Kumar","(Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology,Sector-3,Dwarka,New Delhi ,110078,India)",India
