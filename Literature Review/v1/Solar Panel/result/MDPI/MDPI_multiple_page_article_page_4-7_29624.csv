On Maximizing the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks by Optimally Assigning Energy Supplies,https://doi.org/10.3390/s130810219,26,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,lifetime optimization,energy supply assignment","
Abstract
      The extension of the network lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an important issue that has not been appropriately solved yet. This paper addresses this concern and proposes some techniques to plan an arbitrary WSN. To this end, we suggest a hierarchical network architecture, similar to realistic scenarios, where nodes with renewable energy sources (denoted as primary nodes) carry out most message delivery tasks, and nodes equipped with conventional chemical batteries (denoted as secondary nodes) are those with less communication demands. The key design issue of this network architecture is the development of a new optimization framework to calculate the optimal assignment of renewable energy supplies (primary node assignment) to maximize network lifetime, obtaining the minimum number of energy supplies and their node assignment. We also conduct a second optimization step to additionally minimize the number of packet hops between the source and the sink. In this work, we present an algorithm that approaches the results of the optimization framework, but with much faster execution speed, which is a good alternative for large-scale WSN networks. Finally, the network model, the optimization process and the designed algorithm are further evaluated and validated by means of computer simulation under realistic conditions. The results obtained are discussed comparatively.

A Smart and Balanced Energy-Efficient Multihop Clustering Algorithm (Smart-BEEM) for MIMO IoT Systems in Future Networks †,https://doi.org/10.3390/s17071574,53,Article,MDPI,"WSN,MIMO,Energy Efficiency,QoE,Clustering,IoT,Future Network,5G","
Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are typically composed of thousands of sensors powered by limited energy resources. Clustering techniques were introduced to prolong network longevity offering the promise of green computing. However, most existing work fails to consider the network coverage when evaluating the lifetime of a network. We believe that balancing the energy consumption in per unit area rather than on each single sensor can provide better-balanced power usage throughout the network. Our former work—Balanced Energy-Efficiency (BEE) and its Multihop version BEEM can not only extend the network longevity, but also maintain the network coverage. Following WSNs, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been proposed with higher degree of diversities in terms of communication abilities and user scenarios, supporting a large range of real world applications. The IoT devices are embedded with multiple communication interfaces, normally referred as Multiple-In and Multiple-Out (MIMO) in 5G networks. The applications running on those devices can generate various types of data. Every interface has its own characteristics, which may be preferred and beneficial in some specific user scenarios. With MIMO becoming more available on the IoT devices, an advanced clustering solution for highly dynamic IoT systems is missing and also pressingly demanded in order to cater for differing user applications. In this paper, we present a smart clustering algorithm (Smart-BEEM) based on our former work BEE(M) to accomplish energy efficient and Quality of user Experience (QoE) supported communication in cluster based IoT networks. It is a user behaviour and context aware approach, aiming to facilitate IoT devices to choose beneficial communication interfaces and cluster headers for data transmission. Experimental results have proved that Smart-BEEM can further improve the performance of BEE and BEEM for coverage sensitive longevity.

A Novel Power Efficient Location-Based Cooperative  Routing with Transmission Power-Upper-Limit for  Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s130506448,9,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,power conservation,cooperative communication,bad nodes avoidance,power efficient","
Abstract
      The extensive usage of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the development of many power- and energy-efficient routing protocols. Cooperative routing in WSNs can improve performance in these types of networks. In this paper we discuss the existing proposals and we propose a routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks called Power Efficient Location-based Cooperative Routing with Transmission Power-upper-limit (PELCR-TP). The algorithm is based on the principle of minimum link power and aims to take advantage of nodes cooperation to make the link work well in WSNs with a low transmission power. In the proposed scheme, with a determined transmission power upper limit, nodes find the most appropriate next nodes and single-relay nodes with the proposed algorithm. Moreover, this proposal subtly avoids non-working nodes, because we add a Bad nodes Avoidance Strategy (BAS). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm with BAS can significantly improve the performance in reducing the overall link power, enhancing the transmission success rate and decreasing the retransmission rate.

Fuzzy-Logic Based Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s17071554,90,Article,MDPI,"non-uniform distribution,distributed clustering,load balance,TSK fuzzy model,neighbor nodes’ energy","
Abstract
Due to the high-energy efficiency and scalability, the clustering routing algorithm has been widely used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In order to gather information more efficiently, each sensor node transmits data to its Cluster Head (CH) to which it belongs, by multi-hop communication. However, the multi-hop communication in the cluster brings the problem of excessive energy consumption of the relay nodes which are closer to the CH. These nodes’ energy will be consumed more quickly than the farther nodes, which brings the negative influence on load balance for the whole networks. Therefore, we propose an energy-efficient distributed clustering algorithm based on fuzzy approach with non-uniform distribution (EEDCF). During CHs’ election, we take nodes’ energies, nodes’ degree and neighbor nodes’ residual energies into consideration as the input parameters. In addition, we take advantage of Takagi, Sugeno and Kang (TSK) fuzzy model instead of traditional method as our inference system to guarantee the quantitative analysis more reasonable. In our scheme, each sensor node calculates the probability of being as CH with the help of fuzzy inference system in a distributed way. The experimental results indicate EEDCF algorithm is better than some current representative methods in aspects of data transmission, energy consumption and lifetime of networks.

Development of ICT for Leaching Monitoring in Taiwan Agricultural LTER Stations,https://doi.org/10.3390/environments4030047,3,Article,MDPI,"lysimeter,data loggers,data transmission,Arduino,real-time monitoring,database,open source","
Abstract
In order to study the groundwater subsidy from different cropping systems, leaching monitoring in Taiwan started in 2008 and implemented agricultural long-term ecological research (LTER) stations. Initially, leaching data was received by lysimeters, and then collected manually by laborers in the field twice per month. The cost of data collection and transmission is high, real-time monitoring is not possible, and maintenance of instruments is inefficient. In this study, the goal is to develop a data transmission path. ICT (Information and Communication Technology) with different data transmission schemes was applied to improve the efficiency and immediacy of data transfer from the field to the databases in labs. Between 2010 and 2017, four versions of ICT have been developed and applied in LTER stations. WiFi, 2.5G (General Packet Radio Service, GPRS), 3G/4G network transmission, and Arduino cores are applied in different ICT versions. The first version of data transmission used data loggers, developed by the original factory, with a lower cost of renovation of instruments. However, complicated transmission paths, diverse instruments, poor weather resistance, and lack of wireless functionality are the limitations of the first version. Those limitations had been overcome by the second and third versions by using 2.5G (GPRS) and 3G/4G network transmission, respectively. Nevertheless, these versions are limited to the processes of data compression and encryption transmission which were developed by the system vendors. In addition, data can only be collected through the webpage provided by the vendors, instead of being received directly from the database using SQL (Structured Query Language). This is inappropriate for advanced data treatment, organization, and analysis. Finally, the fourth version of data transmission has been developed using Arduino. This system allows redesigning of the data loggers and transmission instrument with more feasibility and flexibility. Radio Frequency (Radio frequency, RF) has been imported into the transmission path to receive data from diverse instruments with fewer data loggers. In conclusion, ICT technological advancement with its advantages of reasonable cost and high flexibility and feasibility, Arduino and other open source operation systems can be used to develop the data loggers and related instruments to meet the needs of users. Therefore, ICT is the most appropriate strategy to develop the long-term monitoring system in the field and to apply to other environment monitoring systems.

Mineralogy and Trace Element Chemistry of Ferberite/Reinite from Tungsten Deposits in Central Rwanda,https://doi.org/10.3390/min3020121,50,Article,MDPI,"tungsten deposits,wolframite,ferberite,reinite,mineralogy,trace element chemistry,rare earth elements,Nyakabingo,Gifurwe,Bugarama,Rwanda","
Abstract
 Tungsten mineralization in hydrothermal quartz veins from the Nyakabingo, Gifurwe and Bugarama deposits in central Rwanda occurs as the iron-rich endmember of the wolframite solid solution series (ferberite) and in the particular form of reinite, which represents a pseudomorph of ferberite after scheelite. Primary ferberite, reinite and late secondary ferberite are characterized by their trace element chemistry and rare earth element patterns. The replacement of scheelite by ferberite is also documented in the trace element composition. Primary ferberite shows high Mg, Zn, Sc, V, Nb, In and Sn concentrations, but very low Ca, Pb, Sr and Ba contents. Reinite and late secondary ferberite display an uncommon trace element composition containing high concentrations of Ca, Pb, Sr, Ba, As and Ga, but very low levels in Sn, Zr, Hf, In, Ti, Sc, Nb, Ta, Mg and Zn. Late secondary ferberite replacing primary ferberite is characterized by additional enrichments in Bi, Pb, As and Sb. The rare earth element patterns of reinite and secondary ferberite are also similar to hydrothermal scheelite. The formation of the tungsten deposits in central Rwanda is interpreted to be epigenetic in origin, and the hydrothermal mineralizing fluids are related to the intrusion of the G4-granites.

Data Aggregation Based on Overlapping Rate of Sensing Area in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s17071527,7,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,data aggregation,overlapping rate of sensing area,data accuracy","
Abstract
Wireless sensor networks are required in smart applications to provide accurate control, where the high density of sensors brings in a large quantity of redundant data. In order to reduce the waste of limited network resources, data aggregation is utilized to avoid redundancy forwarding. However, most of aggregation schemes reduce information accuracy and prolong end-to-end delay when eliminating transmission overhead. In this paper, we propose a data aggregation scheme based on overlapping rate of sensing area, namely AggOR, aiming for energy-efficient data collection in wireless sensor networks with high information accuracy. According to aggregation rules, gathering nodes are selected from candidate parent nodes and appropriate neighbor nodes considering a preset threshold of overlapping rate of sensing area. Therefore, the collected data in a gathering area are highly correlated, and a large amount of redundant data could be cleaned. Meanwhile, AggOR keeps the original entropy by only deleting the duplicated data. Experiment results show that compared with others, AggOR has a high data accuracy and a short end-to-end delay with a similar network lifetime.

A Transmission Power Optimization with a Minimum Node Degree for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks with  Full-Reachability,https://doi.org/10.3390/s130303951,16,Article,MDPI,"transmission optimization,minimum node degree,energy-efficient,full reachability networks","
Abstract
      Transmission power optimization is the most significant factor in prolonging the lifetime and maintaining the connection quality of wireless sensor networks. Un-optimized transmission power of nodes either interferes with or fails to link neighboring nodes. The optimization of transmission power depends on the expected node degree and node distribution. In this study, an optimization approach to an energy-efficient and full reachability wireless sensor network is proposed. In the proposed approach, an adjustment model of the transmission range with a minimum node degree is proposed that focuses on topology control and optimization of the transmission range according to node degree and node density. The model adjusts the tradeoff between energy efficiency and full reachability to obtain an ideal transmission range. In addition, connectivity and reachability are used as performance indices to evaluate the connection quality of a network. The two indices are compared to demonstrate the practicability of framework through simulation results. Furthermore, the relationship between the indices under the conditions of various node degrees is analyzed to generalize the characteristics of node densities. The research results on the reliability and feasibility of the proposed approach will benefit the future real deployments.

Abstract
In 2016, there were 317 serious water pollution incidents in the UK, with 78,000 locations where businesses discharge controlled quantities of pollutants into rivers; therefore, continuous monitoring is vital. Since 1998, the environment agency has taken over 50 million water samples for water quality monitoring. The Internet of Things has grown phenomenally in recent years, reaching all aspects of our lives, many of these connected devices use wireless sensor networks to relay data to internet-connected nodes, where data can be processed, analyzed and consumed. However, Underwater wireless communications rely mainly on alternative communication methods such as optical and acoustic, with radio frequencies being an under-exploited method. This research presents real world results conducted in the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for the novel use of the 433 MHz radio frequency combined with a bowtie antenna in underwater communications in raw water, achieving distances of 7 m at 1.2 kbps and 5 m at 25 kbps.

Energy Efficient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks Through Balanced Clustering,https://doi.org/10.3390/a6010029,173,Article,MDPI,"WSNs,energy efficiency,hierarchical routing,Gaussian elimination","
Abstract
The wide utilization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is obstructed by the severely limited energy constraints of the individual sensor nodes. This is the reason why a large part of the research in WSNs focuses on the development of energy efficient routing protocols. In this paper, a new protocol called Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol (ECHERP), which pursues energy conservation through balanced clustering, is proposed. ECHERP models the network as a linear system and, using the Gaussian elimination algorithm, calculates the combinations of nodes that can be chosen as cluster heads in order to extend the network lifetime. The performance evaluation of ECHERP is carried out through simulation tests, which evince the effectiveness of this protocol in terms of network energy efficiency when compared against other well-known protocols.

Prioritized Degree Distribution in Wireless Sensor Networks with a Network Coded Data Collection Method,https://doi.org/10.3390/s121217128,4,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,distributed storage,network coding","
Abstract
      The reliability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be greatly affected by failures of sensor nodes due to energy exhaustion or the influence of brutal external environment conditions. Such failures seriously affect the data persistence and collection efficiency. Strategies based on network coding technology for WSNs such as LTCDS can improve the data persistence without mass redundancy. However, due to the bad intermediate performance of LTCDS, a serious ‘cliff effect’ may appear during the decoding period, and source data are hard to recover from sink nodes before sufficient encoded packets are collected. In this paper, the influence of coding degree distribution strategy on the ‘cliff effect’ is observed and the prioritized data storage and dissemination algorithm PLTD-ALPHA is presented to achieve better data persistence and recovering performance. With PLTD-ALPHA, the data in sensor network nodes present a trend that their degree distribution increases along with the degree level predefined, and the persistent data packets can be submitted to the sink node according to its degree in order. Finally, the performance of PLTD-ALPHA is evaluated and experiment results show that PLTD-ALPHA can greatly improve the data collection performance and decoding efficiency, while data persistence is not notably affected.

Abstract
      The issues inherent in caring for an ever-increasing aged population has been the subject of endless debate and continues to be a hot topic for political discussion. The use of hospital-based facilities for the monitoring of chronic physiological conditions is expensive and ties up key healthcare professionals. The introduction of wireless sensor devices as part of a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) integrated within an overall eHealth solution could bring a step change in the remote management of patient healthcare. Sensor devices small enough to be placed either inside or on the human body can form a vital part of an overall health monitoring network. An effectively designed energy efficient WBAN should have a minimal impact on the mobility and lifestyle of the patient. WBAN technology can be deployed within a hospital, care home environment or in the patient's own home. This study is a review of the existing research in the area of WBAN technology and in particular protocol adaptation and energy efficient cross-layer design. The research reviews the work carried out across various layers of the protocol stack and highlights how the latest research proposes to resolve the various challenges inherent in remote continual healthcare monitoring.

Abstract
In the Threshold-Sensitive Stable Election Protocol, sensors are randomly deployed in the region without considering the balanced energy consumption of nodes. If a node that has been selected as a cluster head is located far away from the base station, it will affect the efficiency of the network due to its early death. This paper proposes an improved energy efficient routing protocol named Improved Threshold-Sensitive Stable Election protocol (ITSEP) for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Firstly, we use a node state transformation mechanism to control the number of cluster heads in high-density node areas. Secondly, the proposed protocol improves the threshold formula by considering the distance from the node to the base station, the number of neighbor nodes, its residual energy, and the average distance between nodes. In addition, an optimal route with minimum energy consumption for cluster heads has been selected throughout data transmission. Simulation results show that this algorithm has achieved a longer lifetime than the stable election protocol algorithm, modified stable election protocol algorithm, and threshold-sensitive stable election protocol algorithm for the heterogeneous wireless sensor network.

Abstract
Before discovering meaningful knowledge from big data systems, it is first necessary to build a data-gathering infrastructure. Among many feasible data sources, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are rich big data sources: a large amount of data is generated by various sensor nodes in large-scale networks. However, unlike typical wireless networks, WSNs have serious deficiencies in terms of data reliability and communication owing to the limited capabilities of the nodes. Moreover, a considerable amount of sensed data are of no interest, meaningless, and redundant when a large number of sensor nodes is densely deployed. Many studies address the existing problems and propose methods to overcome the limitations when constructing big data systems with WSN. However, a published paper that provides deep insight into this research area remains lacking. To address this gap in the literature, we present a comprehensive survey that investigates state-of-the-art research work on introducing WSN in big data systems.

Game Theory for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey,https://doi.org/10.3390/s120709055,210,Review,MDPI,"wireless sensor network,game theory,scheduling,optimization,mechanism","
Abstract
      Game theory (GT) is a mathematical method that describes the phenomenon of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers. In particular, the theory has been proven very useful in the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This article surveys the recent developments and findings of GT, its applications in WSNs, and provides the community a general view of this vibrant research area. We first introduce the typical formulation of GT in the WSN application domain. The roles of GT are described that include routing protocol design, topology control, power control and energy saving, packet forwarding, data collection, spectrum allocation, bandwidth allocation, quality of service control, coverage optimization, WSN security, and other sensor management tasks. Then, three variations of game theory are described, namely, the cooperative, non-cooperative, and repeated schemes. Finally, existing problems and future trends are identified for researchers and engineers in the field.

Green Computing in Sensors-Enabled Internet of Things: Neuro Fuzzy Logic-Based Load Balancing,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8040384,34,Article,MDPI,"fuzzy logic,neural network,load balancing,supervised learning,back-propagation learning,clustering","
Abstract
Energy is a precious resource in the sensors-enabled Internet of Things (IoT). Unequal load on sensors deplete their energy quickly, which may interrupt the operations in the network. Further, a single artificial intelligence technique is not enough to solve the problem of load balancing and minimize energy consumption, because of the integration of ubiquitous smart-sensors-enabled IoT. In this paper, we present an adaptive neuro fuzzy clustering algorithm (ANFCA) to balance the load evenly among sensors. We synthesized fuzzy logic and a neural network to counterbalance the selection of the optimal number of cluster heads and even distribution of load among the sensors. We developed fuzzy rules, sets, and membership functions of an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to decide whether a sensor can play the role of a cluster head based on the parameters of residual energy, node distance to the base station, and node density. The proposed ANFCA outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of node death rate percentage, number of remaining functioning nodes, average energy consumption, and standard deviation of residual energy.

A Survey on the Taxonomy of Cluster-Based Routing Protocols for Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s120607350,107,Review,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,homogeneous networks,clustering protocol,cluster head,cluster formation,data aggregation,failure management,resource-aware design,survey","
Abstract
      The past few years have witnessed increased interest among researchers in cluster-based protocols for homogeneous networks because of their better scalability and higher energy efficiency than other routing protocols. Given the limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of energy resources, processing and communication range, the cluster-based protocols should be compatible with these constraints in either the setup state or steady data transmission state. With focus on these constraints, we classify routing protocols according to their objectives and methods towards addressing the shortcomings of clustering process on each stage of cluster head selection, cluster formation, data aggregation and data communication. We summarize the techniques and methods used in these categories, while the weakness and strength of each protocol is pointed out in details. Furthermore, taxonomy of the protocols in each phase is given to provide a deeper understanding of current clustering approaches. Ultimately based on the existing research, a summary of the issues and solutions of the attributes and characteristics of clustering approaches and some open research areas in cluster-based routing protocols that can be further pursued are provided.

Robust Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks for Networked Control Systems,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19071535,12,Article,MDPI,"joint design,wireless networks,clustering,scheduling,robustness,wireless networked control systems","
Abstract
The stability guarantee of wireless networked control systems is still challenging due to the complex interaction among the layers and the vulnerability to network faults, such as link and node failures. In this paper, we propose a robust wireless sensor and actuator network (R-WSAN) to maintain the control stability of multiple plants over the spatial-temporal changes of wireless networks. The proposed joint design protocol combines the distributed controller of control systems and the clustering, resource scheduling, and control task sharing scheme of wireless networks over a hierarchical cluster-based network. In particular, R-WSAN decouples the tasks from the inherently unreliable nodes and allows control tasks to share between nodes of wireless networks. Our simulations demonstrate that R-WSAN provides the enhanced resilience to the network faults for sensing and actuation without significantly disrupting the control performance.

Architecture and Methods for Innovative Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network Applications,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs4051146,40,Article,MDPI,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN),heterogeneous architecture,UAV,multimedia application","
Abstract
Nowadays wireless sensor netwoks (WSN) technology, wireless communications and digital electronics have made it realistic to produce a large scale miniaturized devices integrating sensing, processing and communication capabilities. The focus of this paper is to present an innovative mobile platform for heterogeneous sensor networks, combined with adaptive methods to optimize the communication architecture for novel potential applications in multimedia and entertainment. In fact, in the near future, some of the applications foreseen for WSNs will employ multi-platform systems with a high number of different devices, which may be completely different in nature, size, computational and energy capabilities, etc. Nowadays, in addition, data collection could be performed by UAV platforms which can be a sink for ground sensors layer, acting essentially as a mobile gateway. In order to maximize the system performances and the network lifespan, the authors propose a recently developed hybrid technique based on evolutionary algorithms. The goal of this procedure is to optimize the communication energy consumption in WSN by selecting the optimal multi-hop routing schemes, with a suitable hybridization of different routing criteria. The proposed approach can be potentially extended and applied to ongoing research projects focused on UAV-based sensing with WSN augmentation and real-time processing for immersive media experiences.

Abstract
Recently, wireless sensor network (WSN) has drawn wide attention. It can be viewed as a network with lots of sensors that are autonomously organized and cooperate with each other to collect, process, and transmit data around targets to some remote administrative center. As such, sensors may be deployed in harsh environments where it is impossible for battery replacement. Therefore, energy efficient routing is crucial for applications that introduce WSNs. In this paper, we present an energy efficient routing schema combined with clustering and sink mobility technology. We first divide the whole sensor field into sectors and each sector elects a Cluster Head (CH) by calculating its members’ weight. Member nodes calculate energy consumption of different routing paths to choose the optimal scenario. Then CHs are connected into a chain using the greedy algorithm for intercluster communication. Simulation results prove the presented schema outperforms some similar work such as Cluster-Chain Mobile Agent Routing (CCMAR) and Energy-efficient Cluster-based Dynamic Routing Algorithm (ECDRA). Additionally, we explore the influence of different network parameters on the performance of the network and further enhance its performance.

Abstract
      The specific characteristics of underwater environments introduce new challenges for networking protocols. In this paper, a specialized architecture for underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) is proposed and evaluated. Experiments are conducted in order to analyze the suitability of this protocol for the subaquatic transmission medium. Moreover, different scheduling techniques are applied to the architecture in order to study their performance. In addition, given the harsh conditions of the underwater medium, different retransmission methods are combined with the scheduling techniques. Finally, simulation results illustrate the performance achievements of the proposed protocol in end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption, showing that this protocol can be very suitable for the underwater medium.

An Energy Efficient Cooperative Hierarchical MIMO Clustering Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s120100092,18,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,hierarchical clustering,cooperative communication,energy conservation","
Abstract
      In this work, we present an energy efficient hierarchical cooperative clustering scheme for wireless sensor networks. Communication cost is a crucial factor in depleting the energy of sensor nodes. In the proposed scheme, nodes cooperate to form clusters at each level of network hierarchy ensuring maximal coverage and minimal energy expenditure with relatively uniform distribution of load within the network. Performance is enhanced by cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication ensuring energy efficiency for WSN deployments over large geographical areas. We test our scheme using TOSSIM and compare the proposed scheme with cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (CMIMO) clustering scheme and traditional multihop Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) routing approach. Performance is evaluated on the basis of number of clusters, number of hops, energy consumption and network lifetime. Experimental results show significant energy conservation and increase in network lifetime as compared to existing schemes.

Abstract
      Sensor technology, which benefits from high temporal measuring resolution, real-time data transfer and high spatial resolution of sensor data that shows in-field variations, has the potential to provide added value for crop production. The present paper explores how sensors and sensor networks have been utilised in the crop production process and what their added-value and the main bottlenecks are from the perspective of users. The focus is on sensor based applications and on requirements that users pose for them. Literature and two use cases were reviewed and applications were classified according to the crop production process: sensing of growth conditions, fertilising, irrigation, plant protection, harvesting and fleet control. The potential of sensor technology was widely acknowledged along the crop production chain. Users of the sensors require easy-to-use and reliable applications that are actionable in crop production at reasonable costs. The challenges are to develop sensor technology, data interoperability and management tools as well as data and measurement services in a way that requirements can be met, and potential benefits and added value can be realized in the farms in terms of higher yields, improved quality of yields, decreased input costs and production risks, and less work time and load.

Abstract
      Visual sensor networks (VSNs) comprised of battery-operated electronic devices endowed with low-resolution cameras have expanded the applicability of a series of monitoring applications. Those types of sensors are interconnected by ad hoc error-prone wireless links, imposing stringent restrictions on available bandwidth, end-to-end delay and packet error rates. In such context, multimedia coding is required for data compression and error-resilience, also ensuring energy preservation over the path(s) toward the sink and improving the end-to-end perceptual quality of the received media. Cross-layer optimization may enhance the expected efficiency of VSNs applications, disrupting the conventional information flow of the protocol layers. When the inner characteristics of the multimedia coding techniques are exploited by cross-layer protocols and architectures, higher efficiency may be obtained in visual sensor networks. This paper surveys recent research on multimedia-based cross-layer optimization, presenting the proposed strategies and mechanisms for transmission rate adjustment, congestion control, multipath selection, energy preservation and error recovery. We note that many multimedia-based cross-layer optimization solutions have been proposed in recent years, each one bringing a wealth of contributions to visual sensor networks.

Abstract
      For mission-critical applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) involving extensive battlefield surveillance, medical healthcare, etc., it is crucial to have low-power, new protocols, methodologies and structures for transferring data and information in a network with full sensing coverage capability for an extended working period. The upmost mission is to ensure that the network is fully functional providing reliable transmission of the sensed data without the risk of data loss. WSNs have been applied to various types of mission-critical applications. Coverage preservation is one of the most essential functions to guarantee quality of service (QoS) in WSNs. However, a tradeoff exists between sensing coverage and network lifetime due to the limited energy supplies of sensor nodes. In this study, we propose a routing protocol to accommodate both energy-balance and coverage-preservation for sensor nodes in WSNs. The energy consumption for radio transmissions and the residual energy over the network are taken into account when the proposed protocol determines an energy-efficient route for a packet. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is able to increase the duration of the on-duty network and provide up to 98.3% and 85.7% of extra service time with 100% sensing coverage ratio comparing with LEACH and the LEACH-Coverage-U protocols, respectively.

Abstract
      A reliable energy-efficient multi-level routing algorithm in wireless sensor networks is proposed. The proposed algorithm considers the residual energy, number of the neighbors and centrality of each node for cluster formation, which is critical for well-balanced energy dissipation of the network. In the algorithm, a knowledge-based inference approach using fuzzy Petri nets is employed to select cluster heads, and then the fuzzy reasoning mechanism is used to compute the degree of reliability in the route sprouting tree from cluster heads to the base station. Finally, the most reliable route among the cluster heads can be constructed. The algorithm not only balances the energy load of each node but also provides global reliability for the whole network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively prolongs the network lifetime and reduces the energy consumption.

Abstract
Smart ocean is a term broadly used for monitoring the ocean surface, sea habitat monitoring, and mineral exploration to name a few. Development of an efficient routing protocol for smart oceans is a non-trivial task because of various challenges, such as presence of tidal waves, multiple sources of noise, high propagation delay, and low bandwidth. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol named adaptive node clustering technique for smart ocean underwater sensor network (SOSNET). SOSNET employs a moth flame optimizer (MFO) based technique for selecting a near optimal number of clusters required for routing. MFO is a bio inspired optimization technique, which takes into account the movement of moths towards light. The SOSNET algorithm is compared with other bio inspired algorithms such as comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and gray wolf optimization (GWO). All these algorithms are used for routing optimization. The performance metrics used for this comparison are transmission range of nodes, node density, and grid size. These parameters are varied during the simulation, and the results indicate that SOSNET performed better than other algorithms.

Simple Random Sampling-Based Probe Station Selection for Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s110303117,7,Article,MDPI,"simple random sampling,probe station,fault detection,wireless sensor network,probing frequency,Pareto principle","
Abstract
      Fault detection for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been studied intensively in recent years. Most existing works statically choose the manager nodes as probe stations and probe the network at a fixed frequency. This straightforward solution leads however to several deficiencies. Firstly, by only assigning the fault detection task to the manager node the whole network is out of balance, and this quickly overloads the already heavily burdened manager node, which in turn ultimately shortens the lifetime of the whole network. Secondly, probing with a fixed frequency often generates too much useless network traffic, which results in a waste of the limited network energy. Thirdly, the traditional algorithm for choosing a probing node is too complicated to be used in energy-critical wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we study the distribution characters of the fault nodes in wireless sensor networks, validate the Pareto principle that a small number of clusters contain most of the faults. We then present a Simple Random Sampling-based algorithm to dynamic choose sensor nodes as probe stations. A dynamic adjusting rule for probing frequency is also proposed to reduce the number of useless probing packets. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the algorithm and adjusting rule we present can effectively prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network without decreasing the fault detected rate.

A Load Balancing Routing Mechanism Based on SDWSN in Smart City,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8030273,42,Article,MDPI,"WSN,SDN,Elman neural network,load balancing","
Abstract
In the wireless sensor network infrastructure of smart cities, whether the network traffic is balanced will directly affect the service quality of the network. Because of the traditional WSN (wireless sensor network) architecture, load balancing technology is difficult to meet the requirements of adaptability and high flexibility. This paper proposes a load balancing mechanism based on SDWSN (software defined wireless sensor network). This mechanism utilizes the advantages of a centralized control SDN (software defined network) and flexible traffic scheduling. The OpenFlow protocol is used to monitor the running status and link load information of the network in real time. According to the bandwidth requirement of the data flow, the improved load balanced routing is obtained by an Elman neural network. The simulation results show that the improved SDSNLB (software-defined sensor network load balancing) routing algorithm has better performance than LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol in balancing node traffic and improving throughput.

Abstract
Locating node technology, as the most fundamental component of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and internet of things (IoT), is a pivotal problem. Distance vector-hop technique (DV-Hop) is frequently used for location node estimation in WSN, but it has a poor estimation precision. In this paper, a multi-objective DV-Hop localization algorithm based on NSGA-II is designed, called NSGA-II-DV-Hop. In NSGA-II-DV-Hop, a new multi-objective model is constructed, and an enhanced constraint strategy is adopted based on all beacon nodes to enhance the DV-Hop positioning estimation precision, and test four new complex network topologies. Simulation results demonstrate that the precision performance of NSGA-II-DV-Hop significantly outperforms than other algorithms, such as CS-DV-Hop, OCS-LC-DV-Hop, and MODE-DV-Hop algorithms.

An Improved Routing Schema with Special Clustering Using PSO Algorithm for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19030671,210,Article,MDPI,"WSN,energy efficiency,energy center,PSO,mobile sink,network lifetime","
Abstract
Energy efficiency and energy balancing are crucial research issues as per routing protocol designing for self-organized wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many literatures used the clustering algorithm to achieve energy efficiency and energy balancing, however, there are usually energy holes near the cluster heads (CHs) because of the heavy burden of forwarding. As the clustering problem in lossy WSNs is proved to be a NP-hard problem, many metaheuristic algorithms are utilized to solve the problem. In this paper, a special clustering method called Energy Centers Searching using Particle Swarm Optimization (EC-PSO) is presented to avoid these energy holes and search energy centers for CHs selection. During the first period, the CHs are elected using geometric method. After the energy of the network is heterogeneous, EC-PSO is adopted for clustering. Energy centers are searched using an improved PSO algorithm and nodes close to the energy center are elected as CHs. Additionally, a protection mechanism is also used to prevent low energy nodes from being the forwarder and a mobile data collector is introduced to gather the data. We conduct numerous simulations to illustrate that our presented EC-PSO outperforms than some similar works in terms of network lifetime enhancement and energy utilization ratio.

A Hybrid Unequal Clustering Based on Density with Energy Conservation in Wireless Nodes,https://doi.org/10.3390/su11030746,21,Article,MDPI,"Internet of things,Wireless nodes,Hybrid clustering,Multi-hop routing,Network lifetime,Artificial intelligence","
Abstract
The Internet of things (IoT) provides the possibility of communication between smart devices and any object at any time. In this context, wireless nodes play an important role in reducing costs and simple use. Since these nodes are often used in less accessible locations, recharging their battery is hardly feasible and in some cases is practically impossible. Hence, energy conservation within each node is a challenging discussion. Clustering is an efficient solution to increase the lifetime of the network and reduce the energy consumption of the nodes. In this paper, a novel hybrid unequal multi-hop clustering based on density (HCD) is proposed to increase the network lifetime. In the proposed protocol, the cluster head (CH) selection is performed only by comparing the status of each node to its neighboring nodes. In this new technique, the parameters involving energy of nodes, the number of neighboring nodes, the distance to the base station (BS), and the layer where the node is placed in are considered in CH selection. So, in this new and simple technique considers energy consumption of the network and load balancing. Clustering is performed unequally so that cluster heads (CHs) close to BS have more energy for data relay. Also, a hybrid dynamic–static clustering was performed to decrease overhead. In the current protocol, a distributed clustering and multi-hop routing approach was applied between cluster members (CMs), to CHs, and CHs to BS. HCD is applied as a novel assistance to cluster heads (ACHs) mechanism, in a way that a CH accepts to use member nodes with suitable state to share traffic load. Furthermore, we performed simulation for two different scenarios. Simulation results showed the reliability of the proposed method as it was resulted in a significant increase in network stability and energy balance as well as network lifetime and efficiency.

An IoT-Based Solution for Intelligent Farming,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19030603,46,Article,MDPI,"IoT,M2M stack,constrained networks,intelligent farming,IoT gateway","
Abstract
Intelligent farming is one of the vast range of applications covered by the Internet of Things concept. Notwithstanding, such applications present specific requirements and constraints that are dependent on their purpose. A practical case on which that is particularly relevant is the SheepIT project, where an automated IoT-based system controls grazing sheep within vineyards, guaranteeing that they do not threaten cultures. Due to its rigid requirements, particularly regarding the deployment of the Wireless Sensor Network, Machine-2-Machine communications and necessary interactions with a computational platform available through the Internet, Internet Protocol-based solutions are not suitable. Consequently, a customized communication stack has been developed, that intends to meet the project requirements, from the physical to the Application Layers. Although it has been developed considering the SheepIT requirements, its use may be extended to more generic intelligent farming applications, since most of the requirements are directly related with the farming environment. This paper reviews the proposed stack and details the recent developments. Particularly, we focused on Internet of Things/Machine-2-Machine interaction, describing the design and deployment of a gateway that addresses the SheepIT service requirements. Additionally, and complementary to previously published results, we evaluate the gateway performance and show its feasibility and scalability in a real scenario.

A Hybrid Method for Mobile Agent Moving Trajectory Scheduling using ACO and PSO in WSNs,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19030575,42,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor network,mobile agent,ant colony optimization,particle swarm optimization,moving trajectory","
Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are usually troubled with constrained energy and complicated network topology which can be mitigated by introducing a mobile agent node. Due to the numerous nodes present especially in large scale networks, it is time-consuming for the collector to traverse all nodes, and significant latency exists within the network. Therefore, the moving path of the collector should be well scheduled to achieve a shorter length for efficient data gathering. Much attention has been paid to mobile agent moving trajectory panning, but the result has limitations in terms of energy consumption and network latency. In this paper, we adopt a hybrid method called HM-ACOPSO which combines ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to schedule an efficient moving path for the mobile agent. In HM-ACOPSO, the sensor field is divided into clusters, and the mobile agent traverses the cluster heads (CHs) in a sequence ordered by ACO. The anchor node of each CHs is selected in the range of communication by the mobile agent using PSO based on the traverse sequence. The communication range adjusts dynamically, and the anchor nodes merge in a duplicated covering area for further performance improvement. Numerous simulation results prove that the presented method outperforms some similar works in terms of energy consumption and data gathering efficiency.

Energy-Efficient Fuzzy-Logic-Based Clustering Technique for Hierarchical Routing Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19030561,115,Article,MDPI,"WSN,fuzzy interface system,energy,efficiency,lifetime,clustering","
Abstract
In wireless sensor networks, the energy source is limited to the capacity of the sensor node’s battery. Clustering in WSN can help with reducing energy consumption because transmission energy is related to the distance between sender and receiver. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic model for cluster head election. The proposed model uses five descriptors to determine the opportunity for each node to become a CH. These descriptors are: residual energy, location suitability, density, compacting, and distance from the base station. We use this fuzzy logic model in proposing the Fuzzy Logic-based Energy-Efficient Clustering for WSN based on minimum separation Distance enforcement between CHs (FL-EEC/D). Furthermore, we adopt the Gini index to measure the clustering algorithms’ energy efficiency in terms of their ability to balance the distribution of energy through WSN sensor nodes. We compare the proposed technique FL-EEC/D with a fuzzy logic-based CH election approach, a k-means based clustering technique, and LEACH. Simulation results show enhancements in energy efficiency in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption balancing between sensor nodes for different network sizes and topologies. Results show an average improvement in terms of first node dead and half nodes dead.

Abstract
Precision agricultural greenhouse systems indicate considerable scope for improvement of irrigation management practices, since growers typically irrigate crops based on their personal experience. Soil-based greenhouse crop irrigation management requires estimation on a daily basis, whereas soilless systems must be estimated on an hourly or even shorter interval schedule. Historically, irrigation scheduling methods have been based on soil or substrate monitoring, dependent on climate or time with each having both strengths and weaknesses. Recently, plant-based monitoring or plant reflectance-derived indices have been developed, yet their potential is limited for estimating the irrigation rate in order to apply proper irrigation scheduling. Optimization of irrigation practices imposes different irrigation approaches, based on prevailing greenhouse environments, considering plant-water-soil relationships. This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature, which deals with irrigation scheduling approaches applied for soil and soilless greenhouse production systems. Irrigation decisions are categorized according to whether or not an automatic irrigation control has the ability to support a feedback irrigation decision system. The need for further development of neural networks systems is required.

Abstract
During the past few years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become widely used due to their large amount of applications. The use of WSNs is an imperative necessity for future revolutionary areas like ecological fields or smart cities in which more than hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes are deployed. In those large scale WSNs, hierarchical approaches improve the performance of the network and increase its lifetime. Hierarchy inside a WSN consists in cutting the whole network into sub-networks called clusters which are led by Cluster Heads. In spite of the advantages of the clustering on large WSNs, it remains a non-deterministic polynomial hard problem which is not solved efficiently by traditional clustering. The recent researches conducted on Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, and WSNs bring out the optimized clustering algorithms for WSNs. These kinds of clustering are based on environmental behaviors and outperform the traditional clustering algorithms. However, due to the diversity of WSN applications, the choice of an appropriate paradigm for a clustering solution remains a problem. In this paper, we conduct a wide review of proposed optimized clustering solutions nowadays. In order to evaluate them, we consider 10 parameters. Based on these parameters, we propose a comparison of these optimized clustering approaches. From the analysis, we observe that centralized clustering solutions based on the Swarm Intelligence paradigm are more adapted for applications with low energy consumption, high data delivery rate, or high scalability than algorithms based on the other presented paradigms. Moreover, when an application does not need a large amount of nodes within a field, the Fuzzy Logic based solution are suitable.

Enhanced Message-Passing Based LEACH Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s19010075,23,Article,MDPI,"LEACH,message passing,nonlinear power consumption","
Abstract
This paper proposes a distributed energy-efficient clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, the proposed LEACH-eXtended Message-Passing (LEACH-XMP) substantially improves a cluster formation algorithm, which is critical for WSN operations. Unlike the previous approaches, a realistic non-linear energy consumption model is considered, which renders the clustering optimization highly nonlinear and challenging. To this end, a state-of-the-art message-passing approach is introduced to develop an efficient distributed algorithm. The main benefits of the proposed technique are its inherent nature of a distributed algorithm and the saving of computational load imposed for each node. Thus, it proves useful for a practical deployment. In addition, the proposed algorithm rapidly converges to a very accurate solution within a few iterations. Simulation results ensure that the proposed LEACH-XMP maximizes the network lifetime and outperforms existing techniques consistently.
