Self-Organizing and Routing Approach for Condition Monitoring of Railway Tunnels Based on Linear Wireless Sensor Network,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24206502,none,Article,MDPI,"thick LWSN,network self-organizing,network clustering,routing protocol,energy consumption","
Abstract
Real-time status monitoring is crucial in ensuring the safety of railway tunnel traffic. The primary monitoring method currently involves deploying sensors to form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Due to the linear characteristics of railway tunnels, the resulting sensor networks usually have a linear topology known as a thick Linear Wireless Sensor Network (LWSN). In practice, sensors are deployed randomly within the area, and to balance the energy consumption among nodes and extend the network’s lifespan, this paper proposes a self-organizing network and routing method based on thick LWSNs. This method can discover the topology, form the network from randomly deployed sensor nodes, establish adjacency relationships, and automatically form clusters using a timing mechanism. In the routing, considering the cluster heads’ load, residual energy, and the distance to the sink node, the optimal next-hop cluster head is selected to minimize energy disparity among nodes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in balancing network energy and extending network lifespan for LWSNs.

Green Communication in IoT for Enabling Next-Generation Wireless Systems,https://doi.org/10.3390/computers13100251,none,Article,MDPI,"IoT,energy optimization,genetic algorithm,antlion optimization,routing protocol,DSR,energy consumption","
Abstract
Recent developments and the widespread use of IoT-enabled technologies has led to the Research and Development (R&D) efforts in green communication. Traditional dynamic-source routing is one of the well-known protocols that was suggested to solve the information dissemination problem in an IoT environment. However, this protocol suffers from a high level of energy consumption in sensor-enabled device-to-device and device-to-base station communications. As a result, new information dissemination protocols should be developed to overcome the challenge of dynamic-source routing, and other similar protocols regarding green communication. In this context, a new energy-efficient routing protocol (EFRP) is proposed using the hybrid adopted heuristic techniques. In the densely deployed sensor-enabled IoT environment, an optimal information dissemination path for device-to-device and device-to-base station communication was identified using a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and the antlion optimization (ALO) algorithms. An objective function is formulated focusing on energy consumption-centric cost minimization. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms the Greedy approach and the DSR protocol in terms of a range of green communication metrics. It was noticed that the number of alive sensor nodes in the experimental network increased by more than 26% compared to the other approaches and lessened energy consumption by about 33%. This leads to a prolonged IoT network lifetime, increased by about 25%. It is evident that the proposed scheme greatly improves the information dissemination efficiency of the IoT network, significantly increasing the network’s throughput.

FloatingBlue: A Delay Tolerant Networks-Enabled Internet of Things Architecture for Remote Areas Combining Data Mules and Low Power Communications,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24196218,none,Article,MDPI,"IoT,DTN,BLE,UAV,low power communications","
Abstract
Monitoring vast and remote areas like forests using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) presents significant challenges, such as limited energy resources and signal attenuation over long distances due to natural obstacles. Traditional solutions often require extensive infrastructure, which is impractical in such environments. To address these limitations, we introduce the “FloatingBlue” architecture. This architecture, known for its superior energy efficiency, combines Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology with Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and data mules. It leverages BLE’s low power consumption for energy-efficient sensor broadcasts while utilizing DTN-enabled data mules to collect data from dispersed sensors without constant network connectivity. Deployed in a remote agricultural area in the Amazon region, “FloatingBlue” demonstrated significant improvements in energy efficiency and communication range, with a high Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The developed BLE beacon sensor achieved state-of-the-art energy consumption levels, using only 2.25 µJ in sleep mode and 11.8 µJ in transmission mode. Our results highlight “FloatingBlue” as a robust, low-power solution for remote monitoring in challenging environments, offering an energy-efficient and scalable alternative to traditional WSN approaches.

Abstract
In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a contextually relevant, cost-effective, multihop cluster-based agricultural Internet of Things (MCA-IoT) network. This network utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and LoRa communication technologies, along with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi 3 B+), to address the challenges of climate change-induced global food insecurity in smart farming applications. Employing the lean engineering design approach, we initially implemented a centralized cluster-based agricultural IoT (CA-IoT) hardware testbed incorporating BLE, RPi 3 B+, STEMMA soil moisture sensors, UM25 m, and LoPy low-power Wi-Fi modules. This system was subsequently adapted and refined to assess the performance of the MCA-IoT network. This study offers a comprehensive reference on the novel, location-independent MCA-IoT technology, including detailed design and deployment insights for the agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT) community. The proposed solution demonstrated favorable performance in indoor and outdoor environments, particularly in water-stressed regions of Northern Ghana. Performance evaluations revealed that the MCA-IoT technology is easy to deploy and manage by users with limited expertise, is location-independent, robust, energy-efficient for battery operation, and scalable in terms of task and size, thereby providing a versatile range of measurements for future applications. Our results further demonstrated that the most effective approach to utilizing existing IoT-based communication technologies within a typical farming context in sub-Saharan Africa is to integrate them.

The Potential of Deep Learning in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks and Noise Canceling for the Effective Monitoring of Aquatic Life,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24186102,none,Article,MDPI,"adaptive integrated filters,deep learning,noise cancellation,UWSNs,monitor aquatic life","
Abstract
This paper describes a revolutionary design paradigm for monitoring aquatic life. This unique methodology addresses issues such as limited memory, insufficient bandwidth, and excessive noise levels by combining two approaches to create a comprehensive predictive filtration system, as well as multiple-transfer route analysis. This work focuses on proposing a novel filtration learning approach for underwater sensor nodes. This model was created by merging two adaptive filters, the finite impulse response (FIR) and the adaptive line enhancer (ALE). The FIR integrated filter eliminates unwanted noise from the signal by obtaining a linear response phase and passes the signal without distortion. The goal of the ALE filter is to properly separate the noise signal from the measured signal, resulting in the signal of interest. The cluster head level filters are the adaptive cuckoo filter (ACF) and the Kalman filter. The ACF assesses whether an emitter node is part of a set or not. The Kalman filter improves the estimation of state values for a dynamic underwater sensor networking system. It uses distributed learning long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN) technology to ensure that the anticipated value of the square of the gap between the prediction and the correct state is the smallest possible. Compared to prior methods, our suggested deep filtering–learning model achieved 98.5% of the sensory filtration method in the majority of the obtained data and close to 99.1% of an adaptive prediction method, while also consuming little energy during lengthy monitoring.

Abstract
Various works propose solutions addressing the sustainability of IoT technologies to reduce their energy consumption, especially in the domain of wireless sensor networks. The diversity of applications, as well as the variability of their long-term constraints, forces them to dynamically adapt the network through time. Accordingly, this study formalizes the SADHoA-WSN framework to tackle the reconfiguration process. This proposal is a dynamic Holonic Control Architecture, linking the physical network evolution to the decisions made by a virtual multi-agent control system. The potential of such an approach is demonstrated by applying this framework to the energy optimization of communicating materials, i.e., materials equipped with inner wireless sensor nodes. The first implemented components of SADHoA-WSN and their related experimental results validate it as a promising energy-efficient dynamic methodology. This work lays the groundwork for optimized energy control in IoT networks.

Variational Autoencoders for Network Lifetime Enhancement in Wireless Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24175630,none,Article,MDPI,"data aggregation,energy optimization,data transmission,autoencoder,data compression","
Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are structured for monitoring an area with distributed sensors and built-in batteries. However, most of their battery energy is consumed during the data transmission process. In recent years, several methodologies, like routing optimization, topology control, and sleep scheduling algorithms, have been introduced to improve the energy efficiency of WSNs. This study introduces a novel method based on a deep learning approach that utilizes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to improve the energy efficiency of WSNs by compressing transmission data. The VAE approach is customized in this work for compressing WSN data by retaining its important features. This is achieved by analyzing the statistical structure of the sensor data rather than providing a fixed-size latent representation. The performance of the proposed model is verified using a MATLAB simulation platform, integrating a pre-trained variational autoencoder model with openly available wireless sensor data. The performance of the proposed model is found to be satisfactory in comparison to traditional methods, like the compressed sensing technique, lightweight temporal compression, and the autoencoder, in terms of having an average compression rate of 1.5572. The WSN simulation also indicates that the VAE-incorporated architecture attains a maximum network lifetime of 1491 s and suggests that VAE could be used for compression-based transmission using WSNs, as its reconstruction rate is 0.9902, which is better than results from all the other techniques.

Optimizing Rule Weights to Improve FRBS Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24175548,none,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor network,fuzzy logic,clustering","
Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are usually composed of tens or hundreds of nodes powered by batteries that need efficient resource management to achieve the WSN’s goals. One of the techniques used to manage WSN resources is clustering, where nodes are grouped into clusters around a cluster head (CH), which must be chosen carefully. In this article, a new centralized clustering algorithm is presented based on a Type-1 fuzzy logic controller that infers the probability of each node becoming a CH. The main novelty presented is that the fuzzy logic controller employs three different knowledge bases (KBs) during the lifetime of the WSN. The first KB is used from the beginning to the instant when the first node depletes its battery, the second KB is then applied from that moment to the instant when half of the nodes are dead, and the last KB is loaded from that point until the last node runs out of power. These three KBs are obtained from the original KB designed by the authors after an optimization process. It is based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm that maximizes the lifetime of the WSN in the three periods by adjusting each rule in the KBs through the assignment of a weight value ranging from 0 to 1. This optimization process is used to obtain better results in complex systems where the number of variables or rules could make them unaffordable. The results of the presented optimized approach significantly improved upon those from other authors with similar methods. Finally, the paper presents an analysis of why some rule weights change more than others, in order to design more suitable controllers in the future.

Energy-Efficient Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Grey Wolf Optimization and Enhanced CSMA/CA,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24165234,none,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,medium access control,routing protocols,cross-layer protocols,energy consumption","
Abstract
Survivability is a critical concern in WSNs, heavily influenced by energy efficiency. Addressing severe energy constraints in WSNs requires solutions that meet application goals while prolonging network life. This paper presents an Energy Optimization Approach (EOAMRCL) for WSNs, integrating the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for enhanced performance. EOAMRCL aims to enhance energy efficiency by selecting the optimal duty-cycle schedule, transmission power, and routing paths. The proposed approach employs a centralized strategy using a hierarchical network architecture. During the cluster formation phase, an objective function, augmented with GWO, determines the ideal cluster heads (CHs). The routing protocol then selects routes with minimal energy consumption for data transmission to CHs, using transmission power as a metric. In the transmission phase, the MAC layer forms a duty-cycle schedule based on cross-layer routing information, enabling nodes to switch between active and sleep modes according to their network allocation vectors (NAVs). This process is further optimized by an enhanced CSMA/CA mechanism, which incorporates sleep/activate modes and pairing nodes to alternate between active and sleep states. This integration reduces collisions, improves channel assessment accuracy, and lowers energy consumption, thereby enhancing overall network performance. EOAMRCL was evaluated in a MATLAB environment, demonstrating superior performance compared with EEUC, DWEHC, and CGA-GWO protocols, particularly in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption. This highlights the effectiveness of integrating GWO and the updated CSMA/CA mechanism in achieving optimal energy efficiency and network performance.

Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considerably used for various environmental sensing applications. The architecture and internal specifications of WSNs have been chosen based on the requirements of particular applications. On this basis, WSNs consist of resource (energy and memory)-limited wireless sensor nodes. WSNs initiate data communication from source to destination via physical layer management principles, channel slot scheduling principles (time division multiple access), wireless medium access control (WMAC) protocols, wireless routing protocols and application protocols. In this environment, the development of WMAC principles, routing protocols and channel allotment schemes play crucial roles in network communication phases. Consequently, these layering functions consume more energy at each sensor node, which leads to minimal network lifetime. Even though the channel management schemes, medium control protocols and routing protocols are functionally suitable, the excessive energy consumption affects the overall network performance. In this situation, energy optimization algorithms are advised to minimize the resource wastage of WSNs during regular operations (medium control and routing process). Many research works struggle to identify the optimal energy-efficient load balancing strategies to improve WSN functions. With this in mind, the proposed article has conducted a detailed literature review and notable experimental comparisons on energy-efficient MAC protocols, channel scheduling policies and energy-efficient routing protocols. To an extent, the detailed analysis over these wireless network operations helps to understand the benefits and limitations of recent research works. In the experimental section of this article, eight existing techniques are evaluated under energy optimization strategies (WMAC, channel allocation, sleep/wake protocols, integrated routing and WMAC policies, balanced routing and cooperative routing). The proposed review and the classified technical observations collected from notable recent works have been recognized as crucial contributions. The results infer the suggestions for feasible WSN communication strategies with optimal channel management policies and routing policies. Notably, the simulation results show that cross-layer or multi-layer energy optimization policies perform better than homogeneous energy optimization models.

Multipath Routing in Wireless Body Area Sensor Network for Healthcare Monitoring,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112297,4,Article,MDPI,"healthcare monitoring,wireless body area networks,multipath routing,energy-efficient routing","
Abstract
Mobility and low energy consumption are considered the main requirements for wireless body area sensor networks (WBASN) used in healthcare monitoring systems (HMS). In HMS, battery-powered sensor nodes with limited energy are used to obtain vital statistics about the body. Hence, energy-efficient schemes are desired to maintain long-term and steady connectivity of the sensor nodes. A sheer amount of energy is consumed in activities such as idle listening, excessive transmission and reception of control messages, packet collisions and retransmission of packets, and poor path selection, that may lead to more energy consumption. A combination of adaptive scheduling with an energy-efficient protocol can help select an appropriate path at a suitable time to minimize the control overhead, energy consumption, packet collision, and excessive idle listening. This paper proposes a region-based energy-efficient multipath routing (REMR) approach that divides the entire sensor network into clusters with preferably multiple candidates to represent each cluster. The cluster representatives (CRs) route packets through various clusters. For routing, the energy requirement of each route is considered, and the path with minimum energy requirements is selected. Similarly, end-to-end delay, higher throughput, and packet-delivery ratio are considered for packet routing.

Optimized Routing by Combining Grey Wolf and Dragonfly Optimization for Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/app122110948,3,Article,MDPI,"energy efficient,wireless sensor networks,grey wolf optimization,dragonfly optimization (DFO)","
Abstract
The rapid development of technology has resulted in numerous sensors and devices for performing measurements in an environment. Depending on the scale and application, the coverage and size of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is decided. During the implementation, the energy consumption and life of the nodes in the WSN are affected by the continuous usage. Hence, in this study, we aimed to improve the lifespan of the WSN and reduce energy consumption by the nodes during the data transfer using a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach combines Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Dragonfly Optimization (DFO) for exploring a global solution and optimizing the local solution to find the optimum route for the data transfer between the target node and the control center. The results show that the proposed approach has effective energy consumption corresponding to the load applied. Our proposed system scored high in the average residual energy by the number of rounds compared to other methods such as k-means, LEACH-C, CHIRON, and Optimal-CBR. The first dead node was found after 500 rounds, showing that the proposed model has nodes with better reliability. It also showed a comparative analysis of the transmission rate of a packet concerning mobility speed among various methods. The proposed method has the highest ratio at all mobility speeds, i.e., 99.3, 99.1, 99, 98.8, and 98.6, and our proposed system has the lowest computational time of all the evaluated methods, 6 s.

Abstract
For the past few years, centralized decision-making is being used for malicious node identification in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Generally, WSN is the primary technology used to support operations, and security issues are becoming progressively worse. In order to detect malicious nodes in WSN, a blockchain-routing- and trust-model-based jellyfish search optimizer (BCR-TM-JSO) is created. Additionally, it provides the complete trust-model architecture before creating the blockchain data structure that is used to identify malicious nodes. For further analysis, sensor nodes in a WSN collect environmental data and communicate them to the cluster heads (CHs). JSO is created to address this issue by replacing CHs with regular nodes based on the maximum remaining energy, degree, and closeness to base station. Moreover, the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) mechanism provides an asymmetric key, which is exploited for securing data transmission. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed BCR-TM-JSO model is capable of identifying malicious nodes in WSNs. Furthermore, the proposed BCR-TM-JSO method outperformed the conventional blockchain-based secure routing and trust management (BSRTM) and distance degree residual-energy-based low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (DDR-LEACH), in terms of throughput (5.89 Mbps), residual energy (0.079 J), and packet-delivery ratio (89.29%).

Abstract
With the advancement of new technology, security is the biggest issue nowadays. To solve security problems, blockchain technology will be used. In recent work, most of the work has been done on homogeneous systems, but in our research, the primary focus is on the security of wireless sensor networks using blockchain. Over the last few decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been the most advancing technology due to the number of intelligent devices and associated technologies that have rapidly grown in every field of the world, such as smart cities, education, agriculture, banking, healthcare, etc. Many of the applications are developing by using IoT technologies for real-time monitoring. Because of storage capacity or low processing power, smart devices or gadgets are vulnerable to attack as existing cryptography techniques or security are insufficient. In this research work, firstly, we review and identify the privacy and security issues in the IoT system. Secondly, there is a solution for the security issues, which is resolved by blockchain technology. We will check the wireless sensor network to see how data work on distributed or decentralized network architecture. Wireless sensor network clustering technique was introduced by researchers for network efficiency because when the workload spreads, the system will work faster and more efficiently. A cluster comprises a number of nodes, and the cluster head manages the local interactions between the nodes in the cluster (CH). In general, cluster members connect with the cluster head, and the cluster head aggregates and fuses the data acquired in order to save energy. Before approaching the sink, the cluster heads may additionally create another layer of clusters among themselves. The clustering concept divides data traffic into several groups similar to the other data points in the same data point. In contrast, this data point is dissimilar from other data points in another group. All results are presented at the end of this study paper, in which we will see the network or nodes’ performance in the specific area of the network, how it works, and how efficient it is. Likewise, Blockchain also works in a distributed manner.

Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a comparatively new revolutionary technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we live together with the present system. To enhance data archiving, WSNs are frequently used in scientific studies. Many applications have proved the value of wired sensors; however, they are prone to wire cutting or damage. While preventing wire tangles and damage, wireless sensor networks provide autonomous monitoring. The WS network suffers from a number of fundamental restrictions, including insufficient processing power, storage space, available bandwidth, and information exchange. Consequently, energy-efficient strategies are necessary for maximizing the performance and lifespan of WSNs. As a result, the special cluster head relay node and energy balancing techniques will be applied to deal with WSN energy consumptions. This extends the life of the network. In wireless sensor networks, clustering is a smart approach to reduce energy consumption. Energy scarcity and consumption are serious issues that must be addressed with effective and dependable solutions. The proposed MGSA considers the distance between each node and its corresponding CHs, as well as the residual energy and delay, as important factors in the relay node selection. The proposed approach outperforms the current methods, such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, LEACH (in terms of data delivery rate), energy efficiency, and network longevity. The next level, which will boost the efficiency of wireless sensor networks, with two fitness functions, is proposed. The cluster head (CH) is in charge of collecting and transmitting data from all other cluster nodes. The flow of the consistency of the cluster head selection process will beat the improved data delivery rate, energy efficiency, recommended fuzzy clustering performance experiments, and assessments. As a result, energy-efficient operations are necessary to maximize the WSN performance and lifespan.

Abstract
For decision-making and governance, smart cities depend on tracking data collected via a substantial percentage of wireless sensing nodes. However, several limitations affect Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based Internet of Things (IoT) services, such as low battery life, recurrent connectivity problems due to multi-hop connections, and a limited channel capacity. Furthermore, in many systems, clustering and routing are handled independently, which prevents the adaptation of effective strategies for optimal energy usage and prolonged network lifespan. This research gathers data from heterogeneous IoT nodes linked via WSN and distributed across a smart infrastructure. There are two interrelated problems to be addressed with respect to energy efficiency computations: clustering and routing. We provide a new clustering strategy through which efficient routing of critical and regular data is handled. As a result, both clustering and routing have been significantly strengthened, which balances the communication load across different sectors of the smart infrastructure network. Minkowski distance and ranking strategy are used for routing and selecting cluster heads, respectively. Deterministic distributed–time division multiple access (DD-TDMA) scheduling is employed to balance the communication load across the network. The experimental results show that the proposed work outperforms some of the popular cluster-based routing strategies.

Abstract
Wireless Sensors Networks are integrating human daily life at a fast rate. Applications cover a wide range of fields, including home security, agriculture, climate change, fire prevention, and so on and so forth. If WSN were initially flat networks, hierarchical, or cluster-based networks have been introduced in order to achieve a better performance in terms of energy efficiency, topology management, delay minimization, load balancing, routing techniques, etc. As cluster-based algorithms proved to be efficient in terms of energy balancing, security has been of less importance in the field. Data shared by nodes in a WSN can be very sensitive depending on the field of application. Therefore, it is important to ensure security at various levels of WSN. This paper proposes a formal modeling of the energy consumed to secure communications in a cluster-based WSN in general. The concept is implemented using the Proof of Authentication (POAh) paradigm of blockchain and applied to a Multi-hop Clustering Algorithm based on spectral classification. The studied metrics are residual energy in the network, the number of alive nodes, first and last dead node.

Abstract
Businesses need to use sentiment analysis, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast accurately whether or not consumers are satisfied with their offerings. This paper uses a deep learning model to analyze thousands of reviews of Amazon Alexa to predict customer sentiment. The proposed model can be directly applied to any company with an online presence to detect customer sentiment from their reviews automatically. This research aims to present a suitable method for analyzing the users’ reviews of Amazon Echo and categorizing them into positive or negative thoughts. A dataset containing reviews of 3150 users has been used in this research work. Initially, a word cloud of positive and negative reviews was plotted, which gave a lot of insight from the text data. After that, a deep learning model using a multinomial naive Bayesian classifier was built and trained using 80% of the dataset. Then the remaining 20% of the dataset was used to test the model. The proposed model gives 93% accuracy. The proposed model has also been compared with four models used in the same domain, outperforming three.

Abstract
In a smart city environment, with increased demand for energy efficiency, information exchange and communication through wireless sensor networks (WSNs) plays an important role. In WSNs, the sensors are usually operating in clusters, and they are allowed to restructure for effective communication over a large area and for a long time. In this scenario, load-balanced clustering is the cost-effective means of improving the system performance. Although clustering is a discrete problem, the computational intelligence techniques are more suitable for load balancing and minimizing energy consumption with different operating constraints. The literature reveals that the swarm intelligence-inspired computational approaches give excellent results among population-based meta-heuristic approaches because of their more remarkable exploration ability. Conversely, in this work, load-balanced clustering for sustainable WSNs is presented using improved gray wolf optimization (IGWO). In a smart city environment, the significant parameters of energy-efficient load-balanced clustering involve the network lifetime, dead cluster heads, dead gateways, dead sensor nodes, and energy consumption while ensuring information exchange and communication among the sensors and cluster heads. Therefore, based on the above parameters, the proposed IGWO is compared with the existing GWO and several other techniques. Moreover, the convergence characteristics of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated for an extensive network in a smart city environment, which consists of 500 sensors and 50 cluster heads deployed in an area of 500 × 500 m2, and it was found to be significantly improved.

Abstract
Increasing waste generation has become a key challenge around the world due to the dramatic expansion in industrialization and urbanization. This study focuses on providing effective solutions for real-time monitoring garbage collection systems via the Internet of things (IoT). It is limited to controlling the bad odor of blowout gases and the spreading of overspills by using an IoT-based solution. The inadequate and poor dumping of waste produces radiation and toxic gases in the environment, creating an adversarial effect on global warming, human health, and the greenhouse system. The IoT and deep learning (DL) confer active solutions for real-time data monitoring and classification, correspondingly. Therefore, this paper presents an artificial ecosystem-based optimization with an improved deep learning model for IoT-assisted sustainable waste management, called the AEOIDL-SWM technique. The presented AEOIDL-SWM technique exploits IoT-based camera sensors for collecting information and a microcontroller for processing the data. For waste classification, the presented AEOIDL-SWM technique applies an improved residual network (ResNet) model-based feature extractor with an AEO-based hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) algorithm is exploited for waste classification. To depict the enhancements of the AEOIDL-SWM system, a widespread simulation investigation is performed. The comparative analysis shows the enhanced outcomes of the AEOIDL-SWM technique over other DL models.

Abstract
There are a variety of applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), such as military, health monitoring systems, natural disasters, smartphones, and other surveillance systems. While the primary purpose of sensor nodes is to collect unattended data in hostile environments, many are placed in large numbers and operate independently. Due to limited capabilities, power is often limited. Therefore, these nodes are grouped into clusters to increase communication efficiency. In WSNs, two different routing protocols are possible: apartment and hierarchical or clustering protocols. Due to their significant role in minimizing energy consumption, hierarchical methods have become very popular in clustering. In cluster-based methods, nodes are organized into clusters, and the sensor node with the most resources is appointed as the cluster head (CH). In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) explaining the difficulties in developing cluster-based methods, critical factors for clustering, and hierarchical clustering protocols. The most important factor of a routing protocol for WSN is the energy consumption and lifetime of a network. Focusing on energy consumption, different cluster-based methods were analyzed to determine which technology should be deployed by analyzing specific criteria to support the selection process. Additionally, the pros and cons of different protocols are listed with their relevance in specific scenarios. To identify these protocols, a systematic literature review was conducted using research studies published from 2010 to 2021, with 30 papers analyzed in the final phase. Based on the results of this SLR, several issues need to be further investigated with respect to the interaction of the potential technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs).

Abstract
The rapid growth of technology has resulted in the deployment of a large number of interconnected devices, resulting in a wide range of new societal services. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a promising technology which is faced with the challenges of operating a large number of sensor nodes, information gathering, data transmission, and providing a means to act in different scenarios such as monitoring, surveillance, forest fire detection, and many others from the civil to military spectrum. The deployment scenario, the nature of the sensor-equipped nodes, and their communication methods make this architecture extremely vulnerable to attacks, tampering, and manipulation than conventional networks. Therefore, an optimal solution to ensure security in such networks which captures the major constraints of the network in terms of energy utilization, secured data transmission, bandwidth, and memory fingerprint to process data is required. This work proposes a fast, reliable, and secure method of key distribution and management that can be used to ensure the integrity of wireless sensor networks’ communications. Moreover, with regards to efficient energy utilization, an improvement of the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm (a cluster routing protocol that is mainly used in WSN) has been proposed to enhance the networks’ energy efficiency, simplicity, and load-balancing features. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a combination of a distributed key exchange and management methods based on elliptic curve cryptography to ensure security of node communication and an improved routing protocol based on the LEACH protocol to demonstrate better performance in parameters such as network lifespan, dead nodes, and energy consumption.

Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the core of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, as they will be used in various applications in the near future. The issue of security and power consumption is still one of the most important challenges facing this type of network. 6LoWPAN protocol was developed to meet these challenges in networks with limited power and resources. The 6LoWPAN uses a hierarchical topology and the traditional method of encryption and key management, keeping power consumption levels high. Therefore, in this paper, a technique has been developed that helps in balancing security and energy consumption by exploiting the Trust technique between low-cost WSN nodes called Trust-Cluster Head (Trust-CH). Trust between nodes is built by monitoring the behavior of packet transmission, the number of repetitions and the level of security. The Trust-CH model provides a dynamic multi-level encryption system that depends on the level of Trust between WSN nodes. It also proposes a dynamic clustering system based on the absolute-trust level in the mobile node environment to minimize power consumption. Along with a set of performance metrics (i.e., power consumption and network lifetime), the Cooja simulator was used to evaluate the Trust-CH model. The results were compared to a static symmetric encryption model together with various models from previous studies. It has been proven that the proposed model increases the network lifetime by 40% compared to previous studies, as well as saves as much as 28% power consumption in the case of using a static encryption model. While maintaining the proposed model’s resistance to many malicious attacks on the network.

Abstract
The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reflecting 26% of its GPD and 43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture is the key to producing the best crop yield. Moreover, emerging technologies are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving agricultural resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking these resources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan due to farmers’ illiteracy, lack of a smart system for remote access to farmland, and an absence of proactive decision-making in all phases of the crop cycle available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of agricultural things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible devices and sensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture level, temperature, soil pH level, light intensity, and humidity on frequent intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental parameters of specific farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors, facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation, automated irrigation and guidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control, crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance. The system is integrated with an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in bilingual, i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components, audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels of farmers.

A Hierarchical Network with Fault Tolerance by a Multi-Factor Method for Neighborhood Area Network in Smart Grid,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22166218,none,Article,MDPI,"smart grid,neighborhood area network,multi-factor method,hierarchical network,AMI,fault tolerance","
Abstract
The neighborhood area network of a smart grid usually has hierarchical wireless communication. Due to forwarding and processing more data, the upper-layer nodes are more likely to suffer congestion and energy exhaustion. This phenomenon leads to the failure of uploading data to the control center. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a scheme for constructing a multi-factor fault-tolerant hierarchical network. This scheme firstly defines a criterion for the generation of redundant links by multi-factor method in a hierarchical wireless network with the characteristics of the neighborhood area network. Then the redundant links are used to reconstruct the existing topology of the neighborhood area network for improving fault tolerance. Finally, a greedy routing algorithm is put forward to select a proper data transmission path by bypassing low energy nodes, further reducing the failure of uploading data to the control center. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the fault tolerance of the network topology of the wireless neighborhood area network and balance the network energy consumption. Compared with the original scheme, the proposed scheme improves the fault tolerance by 35% and the relative transmission rate by 21%.

Abstract
A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a group of autonomous sensors that are distributed geographically. However, sensor nodes in WSNs are battery-powered, and the energy drainage is a significant issue. The clustering approach holds an imperative part in boosting the lifespan of WSNs. This approach gathers the sensors into clusters and selects the cluster heads (CHs). CHs accumulate the information from the cluster members and transfer the data to the base station (BS). Yet, the most challenging task is to select the optimal CHs and thereby to enhance the network lifetime. This article introduces an optimal cluster head selection framework using hybrid opposition-based learning with the gray wolf optimization algorithm. The hybrid technique dynamically trades off between the exploitation and exploration search strategies in selecting the best CHs. In addition, the four different metrics such as energy consumption, minimal distance, node centrality and node degree are utilized. This proposed selection mechanism enhances the network efficiency by selecting the optimal CHs. In addition, the proposed algorithm is experimented on MATLAB (2018a) and validated by different performance metrics such as energy, alive nodes, BS position, and packet delivery ratio. The obtained results of the proposed algorithm exhibit better outcome in terms of more alive nodes per round, maximum number of packets delivery to the BS, improved residual energy and enhanced lifetime. At last, the proposed algorithm has achieved a better lifetime of ≈20%, ≈30% and ≈45% compared to grey wolf optimization (GWO), Artificial bee colony (ABC) and Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) techniques.

Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently been viewed as the basic architecture that prepared the way for the Internet of Things (IoT) to arise. Nevertheless, when WSNs are linked with the IoT, a difficult issue arises due to excessive energy utilization in their nodes and short network longevity. As a result, energy constraints in sensor nodes, sensor data sharing and routing protocols are the fundamental topics in WSN. This research presents an enhanced smart-energy-efficient routing protocol (ESEERP) technique that extends the lifetime of the network and improves its connection to meet the aforementioned deficiencies. It selects the Cluster Head (CH) depending on an efficient optimization method derived from several purposes. It aids in the reduction of sleepy sensor nodes and decreases energy utilization. A Sail Fish Optimizer (SFO) is used to find an appropriate route to the sink node for data transfer following CH selection. Regarding energy utilization, bandwidth, packet delivery ratio and network longevity, the proposed methodology is mathematically studied, and the results have been compared to identical current approaches such as a Genetic algorithm (GA), Ant Lion optimization (ALO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The simulation shows that in the proposed approach for the longevity of the network, there are 3500 rounds; energy utilization achieves a maximum of 0.5 Joules; bandwidth transmits the data at the rate of 0.52 MBPS; the packet delivery ratio (PDR) is at the rate of 96% for 500 nodes, respectively.

Wildfire Monitoring Based on Energy Efficient Clustering Approach for FANETS,https://doi.org/10.3390/drones6080193,52,Article,MDPI,"clustering,energy efficiency,WSN,FANETS,LEACH,IoT","
Abstract
Forest fires are a significant threat to the ecological system’s stability. Several attempts have been made to detect forest fires using a variety of approaches, including optical fire sensors, and satellite-based technologies, all of which have been unsuccessful. In today’s world, research on flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) is a thriving field and can be used successfully. This paper describes a unique clustering approach that identifies the presence of a fire zone in a forest and transfers all sensed data to a base station as soon as feasible via wireless communication. The fire department takes the required steps to prevent the spread of the fire. It is proposed in this study that an efficient clustering approach be used to deal with routing and energy challenges to extend the lifetime of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in case of forest fires. Due to the restricted energy and high mobility, this directly impacts the flying duration and routing of FANET nodes. As a result, it is vital to enhance the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to maintain high system availability. Our proposed algorithm EE-SS regulates the energy usage of nodes while taking into account the features of a disaster region and other factors. For firefighting, sensor nodes are placed throughout the forest zone to collect essential data points for identifying forest fires and dividing them into distinct clusters. All of the sensor nodes in the cluster communicate their packets to the base station continually through the cluster head. When FANET nodes communicate with one another, their transmission range is constantly adjusted to meet their operating requirements. This paper examines the existing clustering techniques for forest fire detection approaches restricted to wireless sensor networks and their limitations. Our newly designed algorithm chooses the most optimum cluster heads (CHs) based on their fitness, reducing the routing overhead and increasing the system’s efficiency. Our proposed method results from simulations are compared with the existing approaches such as LEACH, LEACH-C, PSO-HAS, and SEED. The evaluation is carried out concerning overall energy usage, residual energy, the count of live nodes, the network lifetime, and the time it takes to build a cluster compared to other approaches. As a result, our proposed EE-SS algorithm outperforms all the considered state-of-art algorithms.

Abstract
Aiming at efficiently establishing the optimal transmission path in a wireless communication network in a malicious jamming environment, this paper proposes an anti-jamming algorithm based on Dyna-Q. Based on previous observations of the environment, the algorithm selects the optimal sequential node by searching the Q table to reduce the packet loss rate. The algorithm can accelerate the updating of the Q table based on previous experience. The Q table converges to the optimal value quickly. This is beneficial for the optimal selection of subsequent nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has the advantage of faster convergence speed compared with the model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.

An Energy-Efficient Clustering Method for Target Tracking Based on Tracking Anchors in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22155675,9,Article,MDPI,"wireless sensor networks,target tracking,clustering method,energy efficiency","
Abstract
As a key technology in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), target tracking plays an essential role in many applications. To improve energy efficiency, clustering is widely used in tracking to organize the network to achieve data fusion and reduce communication costs. Many existing studies make dynamic adjustments based on static clusters to track moving targets. However, the additional overhead caused by frequent cluster reconstruction and redundant data transmission is rarely considered. To address this issue, we propose a tracking-anchor-based clustering method (TACM) in this paper, in which tracking anchors are introduced to provide activation indications for sensors according to the target position. We use the rough fuzzy C-means (RFCM) algorithm to locate the anchors and use the membership table to activate sensors to form a cluster. Since there are no sending, receiving, and fusing data tasks for anchors, they are lightly burdened and can significantly reduce the frequency of being rotated. Moreover, the state of cluster members (CMs) is scheduled using the linear 0–1 programming to reduce redundant transmissions. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with some existing clustering methods, the proposed TACM effectively reduces the energy consumption when tracking a moving target, thus prolonging the network lifetime.

Abstract
Recent developments in low-power communication and signal processing technologies have led to the extensive implementation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In a WSN environment, cluster formation and cluster head (CH) selection consume significant energy. Typically, the CH is chosen probabilistically, without considering the real-time factors such as the remaining energy, number of clusters, distance, location, and number of functional nodes to boost network lifetime. Based on the real-time issues, different strategies must be incorporated to design a generic protocol suited for applications such as environment and health monitoring, animal tracking, and home automation. Elementary protocols such as LEACH and centralized-LEACH are well proven, but gradually limitations evolved due to increasing desire and need for proper modification over time. Since the selection of CHs has always been an important criterion for clustered networks, this paper overviews the modifications in the threshold value of CH selection in the network. With the evolution of bio-inspired algorithms, the CH selection has also been enhanced considering the behavior of the network. This paper includes a brief description of LEACH-based and bio-inspired protocols, their pros and cons, assumptions, and the criteria of CH selection. Finally, the performance factors such as longevity, scalability, and packet delivery ratio of various protocols are compared and discussed.

Abstract
The concept of the internet of things (IoT) motivates us to connect bulk isolated heterogeneous devices to automate report generation without human interaction. Energy-efficient routing algorithms help to prolong the network lifetime of these energy-restricted smart devices that are connected by means of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Current vendor-level advancements enable algorithm-level flexibility to design protocols to concurrently collect multiple application data while enforcing the reduction of energy expenditure to gain commercial success in the industrial stage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid clustering and routing algorithm with threshold-based data collection for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. In our proposed model, homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes are deployed within specific regions. To reduce unnecessary data transmission, threshold-based conditions are presented to prevent unnecessary transmission when minor or no change is observed in the simulated and real-world applications. We further extend our proposed multi-hop model to achieve more network stability in dense and larger network areas. Our proposed model shows enhancement in terms of load balancing and end-to-end delay as compared to the other threshold-based energy-efficient routing protocols, such as the threshold-sensitive stable election protocol (TSEP), threshold distributed energy-efficient clustering (TDEEC), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), and energy-efficient sensor network (TEEN).

Abstract
In recent years, 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been integrated into a variety of applications to support sustainable communication systems. In the presence of intermediate hardware, IoT devices collect the network data and transfer them to cloud technologies. The interconnect machines provide essential information to the connected devices over the Internet. Many solutions have been proposed to address the dynamic and unexpected characteristics of IoT-based networks and to support smart developments. However, more work needs to explore efficient quality-aware data routing for distributed processing. Additionally, to handle the massive amount of data created by smart cities and achieve the transportation objectives for resource restrictions, artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented approaches are necessary. This research proposes a secured protocol with collaborative learning for IoT-enabled sustainable communication using AI techniques. This approach increases systems’ reaction times in critical conditions and also controls the smart functionalities for inter-device communication. Furthermore, fitness computing can help in balancing the contribution of quality-aware metrics to achieve load balancing and efficient energy consumption. To deal with security, IoT communication is broken down into stages, resulting in a more dependable network for unpredictable environments. The simulation results of the proposed protocol have been compared to existing approaches and improved the performance of response time by 17%, energy consumption by 14%, number of re-transmissions by 16%, and computing overhead by 16%, under a varying number of nodes and data packets.

Abstract
In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), routing algorithms can provide energy efficiency. However, due to unbalanced energy consumption for all nodes, the network lifetime is still prone to degradation. Hence, energy efficient routing was developed in this article by selecting cluster heads (CH) with the help of adaptive whale optimization (AWOA) which was used to reduce time-consumption delays. The multi-objective function was developed for CH selection. The clusters were then created using the distance function. After establishing groupings, the supercluster head (SCH) was selected using the benefit of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) which was used to collect data for all CHs and send them to the base station (BS). Finally, for the data-transfer procedure, hop count routing was used. An Oppositional-based Whale optimization algorithm (OWOA) was developed for multi-constrained QoS routing with the help of AWOA. The performance of the proposed OWOA methodology was analyzed according to the following metrics: delay, delivery ratio, energy, NLT, and throughput and compared with conventional techniques such as particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and Whale optimization algorithm.

Abstract
Microbial fuel cells (MFC) are an emerging technology for waste, wastewater and polluted soil treatment. In this manuscript, pollutants that can be treated using MFC systems producing energy are presented. Furthermore, the applicability of MFC in environmental monitoring is described. Common microbial species used, release of genome sequences, and gene regulation mechanisms, are discussed. However, although scaling-up is the key to improving MFC systems, it is still a difficult challenge. Mathematical models for MFCs are used for their design, control and optimization. Such models representing the system are presented here. In such comprehensive models, microbial growth kinetic approaches are essential to designing and predicting a biosystem. The empirical and unstructured Monod and Monod-type models, which are traditionally used, are also described here. Understanding and modelling of the gene regulatory network could be a solution for enhancing knowledge and designing more efficient MFC processes, useful for scaling it up. An advanced bio-based modelling concept connecting gene regulation modelling of specific metabolic pathways to microbial growth kinetic models is presented here; it enables a more accurate prediction and estimation of substrate biodegradation, microbial growth kinetics, and necessary gene and enzyme expression. The gene and enzyme expression prediction can also be used in synthetic and systems biology for process optimization. Moreover, various MFC applications as a bioreactor and bioremediator, and in soil pollutant removal and monitoring, are explored.

Abstract
Recently, green computing has received significant attention for Internet of Things (IoT) environments due to the growing computing demands under tiny sensor enabled smart services. The related literature on green computing majorly focuses on a cover set approach that works efficiently for target coverage, but it is not applicable in case of area coverage. In this paper, we present a new variant of a cover set approach called a grouping and sponsoring aware IoT framework (GS-IoT) that is suitable for area coverage. We achieve non-overlapping coverage for an entire sensing region employing sectorial sensing. Non-overlapping coverage not only guarantees a sufficiently good coverage in case of large number of sensors deployed randomly, but also maximizes the life span of the whole network with appropriate scheduling of sensors. A deployment model for distribution of sensors is developed to ensure a minimum threshold density of sensors in the sensing region. In particular, a fast converging grouping (FCG) algorithm is developed to group sensors in order to ensure minimal overlapping. A sponsoring aware sectorial coverage (SSC) algorithm is developed to set off redundant sensors and to balance the overall network energy consumption. GS-IoT framework effectively combines both the algorithms for smart services.

Machine Learning Techniques for Energy Efficiency and Anomaly Detection in Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14113125,44,Article,MDPI,"LEACH protocol,EESR protocol,neural networks,support vector machine,energy efficiency,end-to-end delay,intrusion detection system","
Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are among the most popular wireless technologies for sensor communication purposes nowadays. Usually, WSNs are developed for specific applications, either monitoring purposes or tracking purposes, for indoor or outdoor environments, where limited battery power is a main challenge. To overcome this problem, many routing protocols have been proposed through the last few years. Nevertheless, the extension of the network lifetime in consideration of the sensors capacities remains an open issue. In this paper, to achieve more efficient and reliable protocols according to current application scenarios, two well-known energy efficient protocols, i.e., Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and Energy–Efficient Sensor Routing (EESR), are redesigned considering neural networks. Specifically, to improve results in terms of energy efficiency, a Levenberg–Marquardt neural network (LMNN) is integrated. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance, a sub-cluster LEACH-derived protocol is also proposed. Simulation results show that the Sub-LEACH with LMNN outperformed its competitors in energy efficiency. In addition, the end-to-end delay was evaluated, and Sub-LEACH protocol proved to be the best among existing strategies. Moreover, an intrusion detection system (IDS) has been proposed for anomaly detection based on the support vector machine (SVM) approach for optimal feature selection. Results showed a 96.15% accuracy—again outperforming existing IDS models. Therefore, satisfactory results in terms of energy efficiency, end-to-end delay and anomaly detection analysis were attained.

Metal(Loids) Bioaccessibility in Road Dust from the Surrounding Villages of an Active Mine,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12060685,6,Article,MDPI,"road dust,active mine,metal(loids),arsenic,oral bioaccessibility,human health risk","
Abstract
Human activities, in general, cause a significant impact on the environment and human health. The present study aims to characterize the road dust of villages located near an active mine and to assess metal(loids) bioaccessible fractions. From the collected road dust samples (<250 µm fraction), the pseudo total, gastric (G) and gastrointestinal (GI) phase (UBM assay) concentrations, mineralogical composition, enrichment factor (EF), and risk for humans were determined. The obtained results revealed that arsenic represents the highest risk to humans, with mean pseudototal values higher than the maximum reference value range. The enrichment factor pointed to As as having significant to very high enrichment in all of the villages. In addition, Cd presented the maximum EF values in all of the villages, and was thus classified as having a very high enrichment. Particles enriched in As, Ca, Fe, Cu, Al, and Ti were identified by SEM-EDS in weathered agglomerates, and were linked to mine wastes and long-distance transport through both wind and/or traffic. The arsenic bioaccessibility fraction (%BAF) presented low values in the studied samples, possibly because of the low complex solubility of Fe with adsorbed As, limiting the release of arsenic and reducing its bioaccessibility. The concentrations of bioaccessible Cd for the G and GI phases were within the reference range, while for Cu, they were above and for Pb they were lower than the reference value range. The results show that the pseudototal fraction risk is overestimated when compared with BAF%; nevertheless, the total G and GI risks were above the carcinogenic target risk (1 × 10−6) in most of the samples. The carcinogenic risk of the bioaccessible contaminants showed that As represented the higher risk for developing cancer over a lifetime, with ingestion being the main risk route.

A Secure Protocol against Selfish and Pollution Attacker Misbehavior in Clustered WSNs,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10111244,3,Article,MDPI,"secure routing,network coding,wireless sensor network,data availability,selfish behavior,DoS attack,data redundancy,integrity,pollution attack,confidentiality,eavesdropping attack,energy efficiency,security,wiretapper,hierarchical routing,cluster head,scalability","
Abstract
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used for applications in numerous fields. One of the main challenges is the limited energy resources when designing secure routing in such networks. Hierarchical organization of nodes in the network can make efficient use of their resources. In this case, a subset of nodes, the cluster heads (CHs), is entrusted with transmitting messages from cluster nodes to the base station (BS). However, the existence of selfish or pollution attacker nodes in the network causes data transmission failure and damages the network availability and integrity. Mainly, when critical nodes like CH nodes misbehave by refusing to forward data to the BS, by modifying data in transit or by injecting polluted data, the whole network becomes defective. This paper presents a secure protocol against selfish and pollution attacker misbehavior in clustered WSNs, known as (SSP). It aims to thwart both selfish and pollution attacker misbehaviors, the former being a form of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In addition, it maintains a level of confidentiality against eavesdroppers. Based on a random linear network coding (NC) technique, the protocol uses pre-loaded matrices within sensor nodes to conceive a larger number of new packets from a set of initial data packets, thus creating data redundancy. Then, it transmits them through separate paths to the BS. Furthermore, it detects misbehaving nodes among CHs and executes a punishment mechanism using a control counter. The security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution is not only capable of preventing and detecting DoS attacks as well as pollution attacks, but can also maintain scalable and stable routing for large networks. The protocol means 100% of messages are successfully recovered and received at the BS when the percentage of lost packets is around 20%. Moreover, when the number of misbehaving nodes executing pollution attacks reaches a certain threshold, SSP scores a reception rate of correctly reconstructed messages equal to 100%. If the SSP protocol is not applied, the rate of reception of correctly reconstructed messages is reduced by 90% at the same case.

Robust Clustering Routing Method for Wireless Sensor Networks Considering the Locust Search Scheme,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14113019,14,Article,MDPI,"locust search algorithm,wireless sensor networks,swarm-based algorithms,clustering routing protocol,energy-efficiency,metaheuristic algorithms","
Abstract
Multiple applications of sensor devices in the form of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), such as those represented by the Internet of Things and monitoring dangerous geographical spaces, have attracted the attention by several scientific communities. Despite their interesting properties, sensors present an adverse characteristic: they manage very limited energy. Under such conditions, saving energy represents one of the most important concepts in designing effective protocols for WSNs. The objective of a protocol is to increase the network lifetime through the reduction of energy consumed by each sensor. In this paper, a robust clustering routing protocol for WSNs is introduced. The scheme uses the Locust Search (LS-II) method to determine the number of cluster heads and to identify the optimal cluster heads. Once the cluster heads are recognized, the other sensor elements are assigned to their nearest corresponding cluster head. Numerical simulations exhibit competitive results and demonstrate that the proposed protocol allows for the minimization of the energy consumption, extending the network lifetime in comparison with other popular clustering routing protocols.

Lipase Immobilization in Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for Biofuel Production,https://doi.org/10.3390/catal11050629,44,Review,MDPI,"lipase,enzyme immobilization,mesoporous silica","
Abstract
Lipases are ubiquitous enzymes whose physiological role is the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol into fatty acids. They are the most studied and industrially interesting enzymes, thanks to their versatility to promote a plethora of reactions on a wide range of substrates. In fact, depending on the reaction conditions, they can also catalyze synthesis reactions, such as esterification, acidolysis and transesterification. The latter is particularly important for biodiesel production. Biodiesel can be produced from animal fats or vegetable oils and is considered as a biodegradable, non-toxic and renewable energy source. The use of lipases as industrial catalysts is subordinated to their immobilization on insoluble supports, to allow multiple uses and use in continuous processes, but also to stabilize the enzyme, intrinsically prone to denaturation with consequent loss of activity. Among the materials that can be used for lipase immobilization, mesoporous silica nanoparticles represent a good choice due to the combination of thermal and mechanical stability with controlled textural characteristics. Moreover, the presence of abundant surface hydroxyl groups allows for easy chemical surface functionalization. This latter aspect has the main importance since lipases have a high affinity with hydrophobic supports. The objective of this work is to provide an overview of the recent progress of lipase immobilization in mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a focus on biodiesel production.

Energy-Efficient Fuzzy Management System for Internet of Things Connected Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10091068,31,Article,MDPI,"fuzzy logic,IoT,intelligent system,energy efficiency","
Abstract
Many algorithms use clustering to improve vehicular ad hoc network performance. The expected points of many of these approaches support multiple rounds of data to the roadside unit and constantly include clustering in every round of single-hop data transmission towards the road side unit; however, the clustering in every round maximizes the number of control messages and there could be the possibility of collision and decreases in network energy. Multi-hop transmission prolongs the cluster head node’s lifetime and boosts the network’s efficiency. Accordingly, this article proposes a new fuzzy-clustering-based routing algorithm to benefit from multi-hop transmission clustering simultaneously. This research has analyzed the limitation of clustering in each round, different algorithms were used to perform the clustering, and multi-hop routing was used to transfer the data of every cluster to the road side unit. The fuzzy logic was used to choose the head node of each cluster. Three parameters, (1) distance of each node, (2) remaining energy, and (3) number of neighbors of every node, were considered as fuzzy criteria. The results of this research were compared to various other algorithms in relation to parameters like dead node in every round, first node expire, half node expire, last node expire, and the network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. On the other hand, the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment is vulnerable at the time of data transmission. The NS-2 software tool was used to simulate and evaluate the proposed fuzzy logic opportunistic routing’s performance results concerning end-to-end delay, packet delivery, and network throughput. We compare to the existing protocols, such as fuzzy Internet of Things (IoT), two fuzzy, and Fuzzy-Based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS). The performance comparison also emphasizes an effective utilization of the resources. Simulations on the highway environment show that the suggested protocol has an improved Quality of Service (QoS) efficiency compared to the above published methods in the literature.

Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the interrelation of physical things and devices that can be accessed through the internet and it simply forms a single integrated network of various things. An IoT-facilitated smart city scenario spans several sectors, such as industrial applications, public transportation, smart grid, emergency services, health care, etc. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Proficient Data Collection Approach (IPDCA) to deliver public data in a large-scale smart city set-up. IPDCA utilizes public vehicles as the mobile data collectors (D-collectors) that read (or collect) data from multiple Access Points (APs) and send them back to the central Base Station (BS). Moreover, IPDCA adopts a modified Bat algorithm for path finding of D-collectors, where we extend the Bat algorithm to solve our discrete optimization problem. Besides, for selecting D-collectors in smart city settings, we use a multi-objective fitness function that considers the count, travelled distance, and storage of D-collectors to ensure optimal use of resources. Efficiency of the proposed mechanism is proved through simulations.

New Protocol and Architecture for a Wastewater Treatment System Intended for Irrigation,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11083648,5,Article,MDPI,"sensor network,LoRa,water quality,contamination,precision agriculture","
Abstract
Water quality may be affected by aspects such as pollution from industries, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides, and waste produced by humans. This contamination can affect the produce of the fields irrigated by untreated water. Therefore, it is necessary to add a treatment process in irrigation systems. In this paper, an architecture, communication protocol, and a data analysis algorithm for a wastewater treatment system intended for irrigation are presented. Our system includes a smart group-based wireless sensor network that is able to detect high salinity levels and pollution stains, such as oil spills. When contamination is detected, the water is led into auxiliary canals that perform the biosorption process to treat the water and dump it back into the main canal. Simulations were performed to assess the amount of data stored on the secure digital (SD) card, the consumed bandwidth, and the energy consumption of our proposal. The results show the system has a low bandwidth consumption with a maximum of 2.58 kbps for the setting of two daily data transmissions of the node in the last auxiliary canal. Furthermore, it can sustain the energy consumption in adverse conditions, where the node with the highest energy consumption reaches the lowest energy value of 12,320 mW/h.

Spectrum Based Power Management for Congested IoT Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21082681,6,Article,MDPI,"energy consumption,spectrum management,freescale launchpads,congested IoT","
Abstract
With constantly increasing demand in connected society Internet of Things (IoT) network is frequently becoming congested. IoT sensor devices lose more power while transmitting data through congested IoT networks. Currently, in most scenarios, the distributed IoT devices in use have no effective spectrum based power management, and have no guarantee of a long term battery life while transmitting data through congested IoT networks. This puts user information at risk, which could lead to loss of important information in communication. In this paper, we studied the extra power consumed due to retransmission of IoT data packet and bad communication channel management in a congested IoT network. We propose a spectrum based power management solution that scans channel conditions when needed and utilizes the lowest congested channel for IoT packet routing. It also effectively measured power consumed in idle, connected, paging and synchronization status of a standard IoT device in a congested IoT network. In our proposed solution, a Freescale Freedom Development Board (FREDEVPLA) is used for managing channel related parameters. While supervising the congestion level and coordinating channel allocation at the FREDEVPLA level, our system configures MAC and Physical layer of IoT devices such that it provides the outstanding power utilization based on the operating network in connected mode compared to the basic IoT standard. A model has been set up and tested using freescale launchpads. Test data show that battery life of IoT devices using proposed spectrum based power management increases by at least 30% more than non-spectrum based power management methods embedded within IoT devices itself. Finally, we compared our results with the basic IoT standard, IEEE802.15.4. Furthermore, the proposed system saves lot of memory for IoT devices, improves overall IoT network performance, and above all, decrease the risk of losing data packets in communication. The detail analysis in this paper also opens up multiple avenues for further research in future use of channel scanning by FREDEVPLA board.

Design and Implementation of EOICHD Based Clustered Routing Protocol Variants for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://doi.org/10.3390/asi4020025,3,Article,MDPI,"cluster head node,EOICHD,energy efficiency,cluster distance","
Abstract
Efficient energy utilization and network life prolongation are primary objectives to be considered when designing a Wireless Sensor Network. Cluster-based routing protocols are most suitable for achieving such goals. Energy and Optimal Inter Cluster Head Distance (EOICHD) is a cluster-based hierarchical routing protocol inspired by the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. EOICHD resolves the problems associated with LEACH protocol, such as selecting cluster head nodes in close proximity. By carefully selecting the cluster head nodes based on residual energy and optimal inter-cluster head distance, EOICHD ensures that selected cluster head nodes are separated by a certain optimal distance. This approach ensures uniform distribution of cluster head nodes across the entire network. The study of the EOICHD protocol presented so far is not sufficient. Hence, in this paper, we propose three variants of EOICHD protocol to understand its behavior in a better manner. A comparative analysis of all three EOICHD variants, LEACH and LEACH-central constrained (LEACH-C) protocol, is performed by considering comparative parameters such as alive nodes, cumulative network energy, data packets arrived at the base station, and stability of the network.

A Cluster-Based Energy Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks with Mobile Sink,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072523,31,Article,MDPI,"mobile sink,energy optimization,cluster head selection,adaptive adjustment function","
Abstract
Aiming at high network energy consumption and data delay induced by mobile sink in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper proposes a cluster-based energy optimization algorithm called Cluster-Based Energy Optimization with Mobile Sink (CEOMS). CEOMS algorithm constructs the energy density function of network nodes firstly and then assigns sensor nodes with higher remaining energy as cluster heads according to energy density function. Meanwhile, the directivity motion performance function of mobile sink is constructed to enhance the probability of remote sensor nodes being assigned as cluster heads. Secondly, based on Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy Protocol (LEACH) architecture, the energy density function and the motion performance function are introduced into the cluster head selection process to avoid random assignment of cluster head. Finally, an adaptive adjustment function is designed to improve the adaptability of cluster head selection by percentage of network nodes death and the density of all surviving nodes of the entire network. The simulation results show that the proposed CEOMS algorithm improves the cluster head selection self-adaptability, extends the network life, reduces the data delay, and balances the network load.
